Attached is the draft EPSA position letter on the Bingaman bill that came out of yesterday's EPSA Leg. Affairs Committee meeting yesterday afternoon.  It expresses strong support for the transmission/open access provisions, while noting six areas needing improvement, including the  two we have noted most especially -- market-based rate authority and transparency.

I think the letter looks fine, but we have any comments or changes we need to get them to EPSA on Monday.  Please advise if you have any concerns about the letter.

Please review this letter and send us any comments you may have by 6 PM EDT ON MONDAY, September 17th.
