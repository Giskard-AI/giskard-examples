Tim -- Cindy manages this program.
Mary -- please give some thought to how we might solicit employee views on 
this.
Cindy -- I believe we already allow matching of donations to quasi-religious 
organizations: religious schools, for example, and perhaps relief 
organizations like Catholic Relief Services?  I think that if we want to 
consider extending it we should probably discuss it in a smaller group than 
the e-speak forum --  the Enron Foundation Board perhaps?  This could become 
controversial, though (recall the Planned Parenthood debate and the periodic 
attempts of shareholders to add restrictions through the proxy mechanism).

Here is one I just know you will like to spend time on.  I want to try to 
convince us to change our matching gift program to allow matching of gifts to 
religious organizations.  My suggestion: hold a discussion on eThink, and the 
let employees cast a vote.  Please advise.
