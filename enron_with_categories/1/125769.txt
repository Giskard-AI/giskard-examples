State's credit takes hit=20
By Dale Kasler and John Hill
Bee Staff Writers
(Published April 25, 2001)=20
Alarmed by the drain on California's treasury from more than $5 billion of=
=20
electricity purchases, a leading Wall Street credit agency lowered its rati=
ng=20
on state bonds Tuesday.=20
Standard & Poor's downgraded California's credit rating by two notches, a=
=20
move that will increase the state's borrowing costs and illustrates a growi=
ng=20
fear that the state's power expenditures could mushroom during a summer of=
=20
blackouts and price spikes.=20
Although the state remains creditworthy, S&P said it has less confidence in=
=20
California's ability to repay its debts. It said the state could be=20
downgraded further if electricity purchases spiral out of control and the=
=20
economy suffers because of blackouts.=20
"This reflects the mounting uncertainty and the cost to the state of the=20
power purchases," said S&P analyst Steven Zimmermann. "The state is still=
=20
strong -- it's just not as strong going forward."=20
Bond ratings are a benchmark of a state's finances, and California official=
s=20
have been proud of their ability to restore the state's ratings since they=
=20
bottomed out during the recession and budget deficits of the mid-1990s. S&P=
's=20
downgrade is the first for California since July 1994 and comes as a slowdo=
wn=20
in the high-tech industry adds to the budgetary anxiety caused by electrici=
ty=20
costs.=20
Still, Gov. Gray Davis' office downplayed the significance of S&P's decisio=
n.=20
"California's economy is still fundamentally strong, period," said Davis=20
spokesman Roger Salazar. "We expect that in 2001 California will continue t=
o=20
lead the nation in economic growth and job creation."=20
S&P lowered California from "AA" to "A-plus" status. That means California'=
s=20
debt-payment ability has been reduced from "very strong" to "still strong"=
=20
but "somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of the changes in=20
circumstances and economic conditions."=20
While it won't directly hamper Davis' plan for solving the energy crisis, t=
he=20
downgrade increases the pressure on Davis to issue $10 billion to $15 billi=
on=20
worth of bonds this summer as part of his rescue package.=20
The bonds are intended to replenish the state treasury as well as finance=
=20
future power purchases. Since mid-January the state has committed $5.7=20
billion to buy electricity for troubled Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and=20
Southern California Edison. The commitment has chewed up a significant=20
portion of a budget surplus estimated by state Treasurer Phil Angelides at=
=20
nearly $6 billion; Davis and other state officials have pegged the surplus =
at=20
$8 billion.=20
Either way, it's clear that the power expenditures have left Wall Street an=
d=20
many state officials nervous. S&P and other rating agencies have had=20
California on a ratings "watch" for some time, signifying that a downgrade=
=20
was possible.=20
"The fact is that the state's credit rating and financial strength will=20
continue to be in jeopardy until the state's general fund is repaid for=20
energy costs," said Angelides, who's responsible for selling the bonds.=20
"We have to get the general fund out of the business of purchasing energy.=
=20
(The budgetary drain) will begin to affect very dramatically the ability of=
=20
the state to provide for core programs, from education to health care to=20
public safety."=20
Angelides spent much of the day urging legislators to pass legislation to g=
et=20
the bond offering rolling.=20
The Legislature already authorized the bonds, but Angelides said it must do=
=20
so again because PG&E and Edison are challenging the formula the state has=
=20
developed for bond repayment. The bond will be repaid with money from a rat=
e=20
hike passed by state regulators, but PG&E and Edison say the repayment=20
formula will siphon too much money from their coffers.=20
Angelides said lawmakers must quickly pass the new bill -- which requires a=
=20
two-thirds majority -- or he might miss a make-or-break May 8 deadline for=
=20
closing on a crucial $4.1 billion bridge loan. That loan is designed to tid=
e=20
the state over until the bonds are sold later this summer. But the lenders=
=20
won't fork over the funds until they're assured the bonds will be sold,=20
because the state will use the bond proceeds in part to pay off that loan, =
he=20
said.=20
Ironically, the sale of those bonds won't be hurt by the S&P downgrade=20
because customer revenue instead of taxpayer dollars are being used to pay=
=20
them off, analysts said.=20
"What's important for the bonds is how the (utility) rates are structured t=
o=20
pay them off," said analyst Susan Abbott of Moody's Inc. in New York.=20
But the downgrade will raise the interest rate on a host of other bonds=20
issued by the state in the coming months. The likely increase is as much as=
=20
one-quarter of 1 percent, said chief economist Ted Gibson of the state=20
Department of Finance.=20
With the state authorized to sell $12 billion worth of general obligation=
=20
bonds, the downgrade could add $50 million to $100 million in borrowing cos=
ts=20
over the life of those bonds, Angelides said.=20
The S&P action also could raise a red flag to anyone thinking of investing =
in=20
a public or private-sector project in California.=20
It "will create perception issues about who we are and where we are in term=
s=20
of the economy of the state," Angelides said. "The real issue here is the=
=20
reputational damage to the state of California."=20
The two other leading credit agencies, Moody's and Fitch Investors Service,=
=20
still have California on a credit watch but haven't issued downgrades.=20
S&P acted the same day the Independent System Operator, which manages=20
California's power grid, declared a Stage 2 power alert. Warm weather and t=
he=20
unexpected shutdown of two key power plants caused electricity reserves to=
=20
fall below 5 percent.=20

Top energy adviser to quit as Davis pushes for plants

John Stevens, Gov. Gray Davis' staff director and top energy adviser, is=20

Like Phil Trounstine, the governor's communications director who announced=

his resignation two weeks ago, Stevens said he needed more time with his=20
family.=20
"It's an immense issue," he said of the energy crisis. "I've given what I c=

to it, and I need to take a break."=20
Davis called Stevens, 54, "one of the most dedicated and loyal people that=

its toll.=20
"This is tough work. This wears people out," Davis said. "He's so self-driv=

that he needs a break, but I venture a guess that down the road, he'll be=

Senators offer bill to put a lid on power prices: Sen. Dianne Feinstein say=
s=20
there's a good chance the proposal can get out of committee.
By Les Blumenthal
Bee Washington Bureau
(Published April 25, 2001)=20
WASHINGTON -- West Coast senators formally introduced legislation Tuesday t=
o=20
temporarily cap wholesale electric rates and expressed hope that their=20
proposal to ease the huge run-up in energy prices might clear the committee=
=20
and make it to a vote on the Senate floor.=20
"I think we are very close to having the votes in committee," Sen. Dianne=
=20
Feinstein, D-Calif., said of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee tha=
t=20
has jurisdiction over the bill. "I am taking nothing for granted, but the=
=20
committee is 50-50."=20
There are 11 Democrats and 11 Republicans on the committee, including=20
Feinstein and the other primary sponsor of the bill, Oregon Sen. Gordon=20
Smith.=20
Smith, a Republican, is the swing vote.=20
Feinstein said the committee chairman, Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, has=
=20
shown an increasing willingness to help her and Smith move the legislation,=
=20
though some differences remain.=20
"He (Murkowski) has told me he'd like to help," Feinstein said. "I think we=
=20
are very close to a markup and this could move quickly."=20
Murkowski did not rule out price caps but said he thought the bill sacrific=
ed=20
long-term solutions for short-term gains.=20
"I have concerns about the proposal put forward today and the impact it may=
=20
have in distorting the market," he said. "It is time to address the=20
underlying causes -- not just the symptoms."=20
Feinstein's comments came at a news conference during which she, Smith,=20
Washington state Democratic Sens. Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell, and New=
=20
Mexico Sen. Jeff Bingaman, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Energy=20
Committee, unveiled details of the bill and criticized the Bush=20
administration and federal regulators for failing to take action to cap=20
rates.=20
If approved by Congress and signed by President Bush, the bill would give t=
he=20
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 60 days to impose price caps or set up=
 a=20
cost-based rate structure that would allow electricity generators to recove=
r=20
their costs and earn a fair return.=20
The controls would apply in 11 Western states, including California, Oregon=
=20
and Washington. Similar legislation has been introduced in the House of=20
Representatives.=20
The lawmakers said the price controls would remain in effect until March=20
2003, when, they said, enough new generating plants will have come on line =
to=20
overcome the West's current electricity shortage.=20
Under federal law, FERC has the authority to ensure wholesale rates are jus=
t=20
and reasonable.=20
Feinstein said that during a warm day this summer California may fall 2,000=
=20
megawatts short of meeting demand and on a hot day with air conditioners=20
cranked up, there could be a 10,000-megawatt shortfall.=20
Feinstein said that in 1999 California utilities paid $7 billion for=20
electricity, in 2000 more than $32 billion and, according to some estimates=
,=20
the price tag could reach $65 billion this year.=20
"There has been a very strong element of price gouging in this," Feinstein=
=20
said.=20
"We should not have to pass legislation to compensate for a federal agency=
=20
not doing its job," Murray said, adding that Northwest utilities were payin=
g=20
the highest prices in the country for next-day delivery of wholesale power.=
=20
"This (bill) will bring the market under control until new generation comes=
=20
on line."=20
Cantwell, who is also a committee member, said wholesale rates have risen=
=20
11-fold over the past several months, resulting in thousands of layoffs in=
=20
the region and the shutdown of the aluminum industry.=20
"We cannot allow our government to sit idly by and allow a tragically flawe=
d=20
and easily manipulated power market to wreak havoc on our economy and quali=
ty=20
of life," Cantwell said.=20
The Bonneville Power Administration has indicated it may have to raise its=
=20
wholesale rates by 250 percent this fall as it is forced to buy power on=20
expensive spot markets because a severe drought in the Pacific Northwest ha=
s=20
reduced electricity production at the region's vast hydropower system. BPA=
=20
supplies 45 percent of the Northwest's wholesale electricity.=20
Smith said that, as a Republican, he was initially reluctant to support pri=
ce=20
control and would have preferred the market sort out its own problems.=20
But, he said, "Hard-nosed business practices that generate big profits are=
=20
not always good politics. It's a mistake to defend a system that some can=
=20
game to make incredible profits."=20
The Oregon senator said he knew his decision to sponsor the bill was not=20
well-received at the White House.=20
"I know I'm not making any friends down the street," he said. "It's importa=
nt=20
to keep this bipartisan, and I'm not going to attack the Bush=20
administration."=20
Both Smith and Feinstein said a FERC staff proposal to cap wholesale electr=
ic=20
rates in California when rolling blackouts are imminent falls well short of=
=20
what's needed. FERC will consider the proposal at a meeting today.=20
"California is not the only state affected," said Smith. "This is not a=20
California problem alone."=20
Feinstein said the proposal was inadequate.=20
"I'm not sure that is the right way to go," she said. "The only reason they=

Energy price gouging might end up felony
By Emily Bazar
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published April 25, 2001)=20
Democratic lawmakers this week will unveil a proposal to make energy price=
=20
gouging a felony -- punishable by stiff fines and possible jail time -- tha=
t=20
could be subject to the state's controversial "three strikes" law.=20
The measure, sponsored by Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante, would punish companies=
=20
that sell electricity or natural gas in California at "unjust or unreasonab=
le=20
rates."=20
"There is a tremendous amount of wealth that is being transferred from=20
California to five companies, mostly in Texas," Bustamante said. "If what=
=20
they're doing isn't illegal, it ought to be."=20
Though lawmakers are expected to introduce the measure Thursday, it already=
=20
has generated opposition from Republican lawmakers and constitutional=20
questions from legal experts.=20
Several aspects of the bill, AB 67x, are unresolved and could change.=20
But the intent will remain the same, and energy companies that take advanta=
ge=20
of Californians will still face significant penalties, said the bill's=20
author, Assemblyman Dennis Cardoza, D-Merced.=20
According to a draft version of the bill and some proposed amendments, a=20
corporation, or a person with decision-making authority at the corporation,=
=20
would be found guilty of a felony if "they collude or conspire to manipulat=
e=20
the market to achieve unjust or unreasonable rates for electricity or natur=
al=20
gas."=20
A state or federal regulatory agency -- such as the Federal Energy Regulato=
ry=20
Commission -- would determine whether rates were unjust or unreasonable. If=
=20
that happened, the bill would open the door for prosecution by the state=20
attorney general or local district attorneys.=20
In addition, if found guilty, companies would be forced to pay restitution=
=20
and could face fines as high as 10 percent of their gross corporate assets.=
=20
Lawmakers are debating whether to make the felony a "three strikes" offense=
,=20
which requires 25 years to life sentences for some people convicted of thre=
e=20
felonies.=20
Though the provision was in an early draft of the bill, Cardoza said it's=
=20
"not likely" to show up in the final version.=20
"While I think this crime is every bit as abhorrent as going in and stealin=
g=20
money from a bank, we're going to have to figure out a little bit different=
=20
way of dealing with it," he said.=20
Even without the three strikes provision, the bill raises certain=20
constitutional issues, said Clark Kelso, a professor at the McGeorge School=
=20
of Law in Sacramento.=20
For instance, he said, it's not clear whether the state can legally base a=
=20
fine on an out-of-state company's gross assets.=20
And the measure, which requires a two-thirds vote for passage, already has=
=20
generated Republican opposition.=20
"To the extent this bill is onerous toward power producers, it may deter th=
em=20
from selling here rather than risk fines and prison," said James Fisfis, a=
=20
spokesman for the Assembly Republican Caucus. "We haven't seen the details,=
=20
but it sounds like it may be a piece of legislation that goes too far."=20

Dan Walters: It's time for politicians to be honest about the energy crisis


(Published April 25, 2001)=20
Gov. Gray Davis is continuing to tell Californians that he's on top of the=
=20
state's energy crisis and, as he said at one gathering last week, "in three=
=20
years, this problem will be a distant memory." Fat chance. All major aspect=
s=20
of the situation are growing worse, not better, minute by minute.=20
Politicians took over the crisis in January as the state's major utilities=
=20
exhausted their cash reserves and lines of credit. Davis began what he said=
=20
then would be a short-term emergency program of power purchases to keep=20
electrons flowing into homes and businesses.=20
From that moment forward, the situation has steadily deteriorated, moving=
=20
toward a three-pronged disaster: severe summer blackouts, the bankruptcy of=
=20
the utilities and sharply escalating power bills. With the bankruptcy filin=
g=20
by Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and decisions by Davis and the state Public=
=20
Utilities Commission to begin ratcheting up utility rates, two of the three=
=20
negative scenarios are now in place. And everyone involved in the crisis=20
expects blackouts this summer as demands for power soar and supplies dwindl=
e.=20
The Davis strategy, if there is one, is to continue the state's massive pow=
er=20
purchases while negotiating longer-term and presumably cheaper supply=20
contracts, encourage conservation, help utilities pay off their debts by=20
selling their intercity transmission system to the state and tapping=20
ratepayers, and build more power plants to ease the supply crunch.=20
Currently, the governor is touting his deal with Edison International, pare=
nt=20
company of Southern California Edison, to sell its portion of the power gri=
d=20
and is working on a similar deal with Sempra, the parent of San Diego Gas &=
=20
and Electric. But PG&E's bankruptcy filing casts doubt on the viability of=
=20
the cash-for-grid concept, and legislators, particularly Davis' fellow=20
Democrats, are very skeptical of the Edison deal.=20
Clearly, Davis rushed into the Edison deal just three days after PG&E made=
=20

warning of long-term damage to the state economy.=20
The bad news from Standard & Poor's came as state Treasurer Phil Angelides=
=20
urged the Legislature to pass a bill this week needed to begin repaying the=
=20
state general fund with a bond of $10 billion or more.=20
The bond would be paid off by ratepayers over 15 years.


"From a small problem that could have been solved in a short period of time=
=20
this is escalating into a big problem," said David Hitchcock of Standard &=
=20
Poor's. "Even if they issue revenue bonds, it could stay with them for a lo=

period of time."=20
Standard & Poor's lowered its rating on state of California general=20
obligation bonds from AA to A+, which means it will cost the state more to=

.=20
The state general fund has spent more than $5 billion buying power so far.=
=20
There are predictions that spending will sharply increase this summer as he=

"The fact is, we can't allow the general fund to be depleted," Angelides=20
said. "There are limits to it. It will begin to affect very dramatically th=

ability of the state to provide core programs for education, health care,=

Davis says he expects to have an agreement within two weeks.=20
=01) Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation of the Whole=

Energy Market continues its investigation Thursday.=20


Standard & Poor's said that if the sale of a state revenue bond is delayed,=
=20
the potential impact on the state general fund could be "severe" without a=
=20
rate hike much larger than the increase of more than 40 percent approved by=
=20
the state Public Utilities Commission last month.=20
"Rate increases appear difficult in the present political environment, and=
=20
related voter initiatives, although none are currently on the ballot, remai=
n=20
a possibility," said Standard & Poor's.=20
The state began buying power after the two largest utilities, Pacific Gas a=
nd=20
Electric and Southern California Edison, were nearly bankrupt. The rates th=
ey=20
could charge customers were frozen under deregulation as the cost of=20
wholesale power soared, producing a debt of $13 billion.=20
Standard & Poor's said the state expected in January to spend less than $1=
=20
billion and resolve the problem in a few months with long-term power=20
contracts at lower prices. But most of the contracts do not begin until thi=
s=20
fall or later.=20
"In addition," said Standard & Poor's, "it is not unreasonable to expect pa=
st=20
and future blackouts to affect business location decisions, and hence the=
=20
ultimate direction of the state's economy."=20
A spokesman for the governor said that Standard & Poor's view of how the=20
California economy will fare during the electricity crisis is far too dim.=
=20
"California's economy is still fundamentally strong," said spokesman Roger=
=20
Salazar. "We expect that in 2001 we will continue to lead the nation in=20
economic growth and job creation."=20
Another Wall Street credit-rating firm, Moody's, has a more positive view o=
f=20
how the governor and the Legislature have handled the crisis and expects th=
e=20
state general fund to be repaid by the ratepayer bond.=20
"We are still at our AA2 with a negative outlook," said Ray Murphy, Moody's=
=20
vice president. "Nothing that we have learned over the last week or so has=
=20
led us to change that opinion."=20
Angelides said legislation is needed because PG&E and Edison are challengin=
g=20
a PUC action last month that gives the state some revenue from monthly=20
ratepayer bills, which is needed to finance the bond to repay the state=20
general fund.=20
The utilities say they need more of the ratepayer revenue.=20
The treasurer said the legislation would bypass the lengthy PUC process and=
=20
authorize the state to issue a ratepayer bond of $10 billion or more. The=
=20
governor said again yesterday that he believes a bond of $12.4 billion will=
=20
cover state power costs this year.=20
Angelides said legislation is urgent because a commitment from three lender=
s=20
to give the state a $4.1 billion short-term loan expires May 8.=20
He said the short-term bridge loan would ease the strain on the state gener=
al=20
fund until the main bond can be issued, probably in late June.=20
The treasurer said that failure to obtain the short-term loan could lead to=
=20
more credit downgrades and "create perception issues about who we are and=
=20
where we are in terms of the economy of this state."=20
Davis has been criticized on Wall Street for not pushing for an early rate=
=20
hike to stabilize the utilities and avoid the need for the state to begin=
=20
buying power.=20
The governor said earlier this year that he could have solved the problem i=
n=20
"20 minutes" with a rate hike, but refused to do so.=20
While addressing the California Chamber of Commerce yesterday, Davis said=
=20
that the long-term contracts will spread the cost of buying power over a=20
decade, causing ratepayers to pay less than market rates in the early years=
=20
and a little above the market rate in later years.=20
"I do not want to shock this economy into recession," Davis said. "I do not=
=20
want to burden small business with more than they can sustain."=20
Davis wants the state to purchase the transmission systems of the utilities=
=20
in exchange for giving them part of the ratepayer revenue to finance a bond=
=20
to pay off their debts. That would enable the utilities to resume buying=20
power by the end of next year.=20
But negotiations to buy the transmission systems has taken much longer than=
=20
expected. PG&E filed for bankruptcy earlier this month, and an agreement to=
=20
buy the Edison transmission system announced a few days later faces=20
opposition in the Legislature.=20
Some legislators, who think Edison receives too much under the complex=20
agreement, have suggested that Edison join PG&E in bankruptcy, where=20
generators accused of price-gouging may not have all of their bills paid.=
=20
"If they go into bankruptcy, the state will be buying power for three or fo=
ur=20
years," Davis told the Chamber yesterday. "That is all we will be doing up=
=20
here."=20
A Stage 2 emergency alert was called yesterday when two power plants=20
unexpectedly stopped operating with temperatures around the state rising.=
=20
Meanwhile, Davis announced that Richard Sklar, a former ambassador to the=
=20
war-torn Balkans, will lead a task force to speed up the construction of ne=
w=20
power plants.=20
The governor acknowledged while speaking to reporters that he has not met h=
is=20
earlier goals of avoiding blackouts, rate increases and keeping the utiliti=

out of bankruptcy.=20
"This is probably the most complicated challenge the state has faced in 50=

I believe we will have this thing behind us by the end of this fall."=20

FERC to weigh limited curbs on electricity prices=20



Caps would apply in Stage 3 shortages

CALIFORNIA'S
POWER CRISIS=20

WASHINGTON -- Federal regulators are expected to consider limited wholesale=
=20
price curbs for California's chaotic electricity market today, but the=20
approach falls far short of the controls sought by many state officials.=20
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission staffers have proposed limiting the=20
price that power sellers can charge for wholesale electricity in California=
=20
only during the most severe shortages, known as Stage 3 emergencies. The=20
"price mitigation" would be pegged to "the marginal cost of the=20
highest-priced (generating) unit called upon to run," according to a staff=
=20
report.=20
Producers also would be required to sell their excess power to the state's=
=20
grid operator.=20
The price controls would last one year and would not apply to other Western=
=20
states suffering from gyrations in power costs and electricity shortages.=
=20
FERC Chairman Curtis Hebert has been an implacable foe of price controls, b=
ut=20
is under considerable political pressure to do more to help California as t=
he=20
peak power-consuming summer months approach. Commissioner William Massey ha=
s=20
advocated far-reaching price limits, while Commissioner Linda Breathitt has=
=20
wavered on the issue.=20
Gov. Gray Davis and other California officials have called for broad price=
=20
controls that also would include 10 other Western states. Yesterday, Sen.=
=20
Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., formally introduced legislation that would=20
require FERC to impose regional price limits through March 1, 2003.=20
Feinstein said the FERC staff proposal was inadequate.=20
"Once you put the cap just on Stage 3, you force the heavier pricing on=20
stages 1 and 2," she said.=20
Other critics have noted that wholesale power prices in California are=20
abnormally high during periods other than Stage 3 emergencies.=20
Feinstein's legislation, first outlined in March, would require FERC to set=
=20
price caps or impose "cost-based" rates that would limit prices to the cost=
=20
of producing the power, plus a set profit margin. New generating plants and=
=20
power bought through long-term contracts would be exempt.=20
However, any state covered by the price controls would have to allow=20
utilities to recover their wholesale power costs from consumers. The clause=
=20
helped draw a Republican co-sponsor to the bill, Sen. Gordon Smith of Orego=
n.=20
Smith and other Western lawmakers have complained about the reluctance of=
=20
California officials to raise retail rates while consumers in neighboring=
=20
states have seen their power bills soar. In recent months, the California=
=20
Public Utilities Commission twice has increased rates for customers of=20
Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric, the utilities hit=
=20
hardest by skyrocketing wholesale power prices.=20
The FERC staff proposal rejected price caps or cost-based rates.=20
It would be hard to devise price caps that are low enough to provide price=
=20
relief, but high enough to adequately compensate generators, the proposal=
=20
said.=20

State's Bond Rating Downgraded to A+=20
Finance: Reduction of 2 notches puts it among states with the lowest credit=

ratings. Move could cost California hundreds of millions in borrowing fees.=
=20

By LIZ PULLIAM WESTON and MIGUEL BUSTILLO, Times Staff Writers=20

?????A major credit rating agency downgraded $25 billion of California bond=
s=20
Tuesday in a move that could add hundreds of millions of dollars to the=20
state's borrowing costs and saddles California with one of the lowest state=
=20
credit ratings in the nation.
?????Standard & Poor's Corp. cut California's bond rating by two notches,=
=20
from AA to A-plus, citing "the mounting and uncertain cost . . . of the=20
current electrical power crisis," which has forced the state to spend=20
billions on electricity to keep the lights on.
?????S&P, one of three major rating agencies monitoring California's=20
financial health, said a further downgrade could occur if the state fails t=
o=20
follow through on plans to issue at least $10 billion in revenue bonds to=
=20
help pay off energy-related debts.
?????"S&P is saying, 'We don't have any faith that what you say you're goin=
g=20
to do, you're going to do,' " said Zane Mann, publisher of the California=
=20
Municipal Bond Advisor, a newsletter that tracks government debt.
?????Wall Street is concerned by delays surrounding the electricity bond=20
issue, but lawmakers hope to pass legislation this week to put the bond iss=
ue=20
on a fast track and speed up return of the money to the state's general fun=
d.
?????Credit ratings help determine how much states and other borrowers have=
=20
to pay when issuing bonds. The lower the rating, the higher the interest ra=
te=20
the state must pay to entice investors to buy.
?????The state Treasurer's Office concluded in a preliminary estimate that =
as=20
a result of the downgrade, California could have to pay $190 million to $57=
0=20
million more on the $12 billion in general obligation bonds the state has=
=20
authorized to pay for ongoing expenses such as school and road-building=20
projects, but has yet to issue.=20
?????State revenue bonds should not be affected by the downgrade, the=20
officials said. However, some bond experts disagree.
?????California's energy crisis already has driven down prices of a wide=20
range of the state's bonds, from general obligation issues that depend on t=
he=20
state's ability to repay to small issues by school districts and cities tha=
t=20
could be hurt by rising electricity prices. Bond traders said S&P's downgra=
de=20
probably would cause prices to fall further.
?????"All California bond holders are going to lose value in their bonds=20
because the state's credit has been downgraded," said John Fitzgerald,=20
managing partner of Seidler-Fitzgerald, a Los Angeles municipal debt=20
underwriter.
?????The downgrade most affects investors who want to sell their bonds now,=
=20
before the issues mature. Investors who hold onto their bonds are still=20
almost certain to get the face value when their securities reach maturity,=
=20
because the state is unlikely to miss any interest payments or otherwise=20
default on its bonds, traders said.
?????S&P analysts said the state's continuing surplus and "deep and diverse=
"=20
economy helped prevent a further downgrade.
?????Still, the downgrade places California below most other states on S&P'=
s=20
rating scale and on par with Hawaii. Among states rated by S&P, only=20
Louisiana has a lower rating, at A-minus, according to Bloomberg News.=20
?????In addition, the two other major credit rating agencies have indicated=
=20
they may downgrade California's bonds. Fitch Inc. said last week that it wa=
s=20
contemplating such a move, and Moody's Investors Service earlier this month=
=20
changed its outlook on California bonds to "negative" from "stable."
?????Some politicians Tuesday accused S&P of overreacting.
?????"It's just unfair, premature and inappropriate for them to do that. We=
=20
do have reserves, we do have good revenue projections, we do have a plan to=
=20
get us out of this," said Assemblyman Gil Cedillo (D-Los Angeles).
?????In a statement, Gov. Gray Davis said California's economy "is still=20
fundamentally strong, period. We expect that in 2001 we will continue to le=
ad=20
the nation in economic growth and job creation."
?????State Treasurer Phil Angelides has been pleading with lawmakers to pas=
s=20
legislation to speed up repayment of $5 billion drained from the state's=20
general fund to buy electricity this year. That figure is expected to reach=
=20
$15 billion by year's end, according to the governor.
?????The consequences of a downgrade are profound, Angelides said, noting=
=20
that it took California years to overcome the downgrades spurred by the=20
recession of the early 1990s.
?????"It is critical that the Legislature act immediately to clearly=20
establish our legal authority to sell bonds and replenish the state's gener=
al=20
fund," Angelides said.
?????California began buying massive quantities of electricity in January=
=20
because the state's three major investor-owned utilities could no longer=20
afford to do so. Since then, the state has been purchasing roughly one-thir=
d=20
of the electricity the utilities need to service their customers, according=
=20
to state officials.
?????Under a plan approved by the Legislature and signed into law by Davis,=
=20
the general fund is supposed to be reimbursed for the power purchases with=
=20
what is expected to be the largest municipal bond issue in U.S. history. Th=
e=20
bond issue is to be repaid by utility ratepayers through a monthly charge o=
n=20
their electricity bills.
?????However, obstacles that threaten timely repayment of the fund are=20
causing consternation among Wall Street analysts about California's financi=
al=20
status.
?????The bankruptcy filing of Pacific Gas & Electric Co., the state's large=
st=20
investor-owned utility, has thwarted the state's plan to restore the=20
utilities to financial health.
?????But it is a dispute over the state's formula for repaying the bonds th=
at=20
has raised the most concern among state officials. The state and the=20
utilities are at odds over how much of consumers' electricity payments shou=
ld=20
go to reimburse the state for its power purchases.
?????The state's two major utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern=
=20
California Edison, have challenged the Public Utilities Commission's plan f=
or=20
splitting up the money--a legal move that threatens to delay issuance of th=
e=20
bonds. The firms contend the allotment granted to the state is too generous=
=20
and could make it harder for them to recover from the energy crisis.
?????Hoping to sidestep the controversy, Angelides is urging state lawmaker=

to pass an emergency measure this week that sets the bond amount and the=20
amount the state will receive from utility payments. The revenue bond was=

Price Controls Spark Deja Vu=20

Energy: The specter of Richard Nixon's actions 30 years ago hangs over=20
current debate on how to check the state's surging power costs.=20

By JAMES F. PELTZ, Times Staff Writer=20

?????A debate now rages in California over whether price controls should be=
=20
adopted to stem the state's soaring power costs and help consumers who are=
=20
bracing for huge spikes in their electric bills.
?????But price controls are one of the most controversial actions in=20
economics--and in politics, for that matter. And now the caps are more in=

dispute than ever because they run counter to the nation's move over the la=
st=20
two decades to deregulate more and more industries, from airlines to=20
railroads to energy.
?????Yet California is a good example of deregulation gone haywire, so=20
controls are again being demanded by lawmakers, consumer advocates and othe=

as a way to check surging prices. On the other side is a chorus of critics=
=20
who ridicule price caps as being ineffective and, at times, making matters=

?????Case in point: the Golden State itself, which tried last summer to use=

prices.
?????Critics claim that the caps drove power sales out of state, thus=20

?????But defenders of the caps note that the dysfunctional California marke=
t=20
had no way to self-correct. The utilities couldn't simply refuse to buy=20
electricity in the face of higher prices, and with no price ceiling in sigh=
t,=20
something had to be done.
?????And now Gov. Gray Davis and others are again calling for temporary=20
controls until more electricity supplies can be added, especially as the=20
state enters the peak-power summer season. On Tuesday, Sens. Dianne Feinste=
in=20
(D-Calif.) and Gordon Smith (R-Ore.) introduced legislation that would impo=
se=20
price controls on wholesale energy throughout 11 Western states.
?????Mindful of the controversial history of controls, Feinstein and Smith=
=20
stressed that the caps would last only through March 1, 2003. But they also=
=20
argued that the economic damage to industries and consumers from escalating=
=20
power costs would exceed any harm caused by price controls.
?????"I have a strong preference for markets, but it's a mistake to believe=
=20
that we have a free market when it comes to energy," said Smith, the only G=
OP=20
co-sponsor of the legislation.
?????Their bill would require the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, whi=
ch=20
regulates U.S. wholesale electricity prices, either to impose a regional=20
price cap or institute a rate schedule for each power generator, tying the=
=20
price of electricity to the cost of producing it.
?????Coincidentally, FERC today is expected to decide on various other=20
proposals to again limit California's power costs--but without explicitly=
=20
stating that the plans include price controls. Why? Because the Bush=20
administration and FERC Chairman Curt Hebert Jr., among others, are on the=
=20
record as adamantly opposing price caps.
?????That's not surprising. Price controls often are tagged as a liberal=20
maneuver that flies in the face of conservatives' free-market ideology. Yet=
,=20
ironically, hanging over the California debate is the legacy of a Republica=
n=20
president who was the last one to mandate price controls on a nationwide=20
level: Richard M. Nixon.
?????The late president took that rare step 30 years ago this August to try=
=20
to quell inflation and spark an economic rebound. His actions were so=20
dramatic that they are still invoked by those wanting to criticize or, in=
=20
some cases, endorse setting limits on prices.
?????"What he did is almost larger than life now," said Shannon Burchett,=
=20
chief executive of RiskLimited Corp., a strategic consulting firm in Dallas=
.
?????Nixon's controls were the most far-reaching since World War II, when=
=20
prices were capped so that profiteers couldn't reap huge sums for scarce=20
commodities being used for the war and simultaneously rationed at home.
?????In most cases, price controls have been much less sweeping and targete=
d=20
at specific products or services. They don't always involve changing the la=
w,=20
either. In 1962, President Kennedy publicly rebuked the then-U.S. Steel Cor=
p.=20
and its chairman, Roger Blough, for starting an industrywide move to raise=
=20
steel prices. The price hikes were rolled back a few days later.
?????Since Nixon, price controls have become rarer as industries that were=
=20
once regulated--which means their prices were government-controlled--have=
=20
been deregulated.
?????So it is in California, where electric utilities' prices were controll=
ed=20
for decades until the state's deregulation law in 1996. But now that the la=
w=20
has been blamed for the soaring wholesale prices, power shortages, crippled=
=20
utilities and the need for a huge jump in ratepayers' costs, some again wan=
t=20
price controls on electricity until the crisis eases.
?????Which brings everyone back to Nixon.

?????Some Nixon Controls Were Lifted by Reagan
?????"I've heard people make the analogy to what happened . . . when Nixon=
=20
put on controls," but in California "this is fundamentally different," said=
=20
Mike Florio, a board member of the California Independent System Operator,=
=20
which oversees most of the state's electricity grid.
?????"When you get into a situation of shortage [of supplies], there is=20
really no restraint at all on prices," said Florio, who said he normally=20
prefers unfettered markets but also defended the state's caps last summer.=
=20
Such government intervention "on a temporary basis is better than nothing,=
=20
but I don't think it's ideal."
?????The reverberations from Nixon's fiat aren't just felt in California=20
either. When New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani recently proposed more stringe=
nt=20
controls on wholesale electricity costs in New York state, critics promptly=
=20
pointed to Nixon's controls. "They were a disaster," one columnist wrote.
?????Even Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who was in the private=
=20
sector in the early 1970s, turned down several requests to take high-level=
=20
White House jobs in part because he was disgusted with Nixon's price contro=
ls.
?????Many economists and historians also judge Nixon's controls as a mistak=
e.=20
But some maintain that his decision--which began with a 90-day freeze on=20
prices, wages and rents--wasn't entirely a failure and even provided "shock=
=20
value" that, for a while at least, arrested higher inflation.
?????In addition, part of Nixon's move involved taking the dollar off the=
=20
gold standard--which in effect meant its price was controlled--and letting =
it=20
float in value against other major currencies. And that, many believe, is t=
he=20
base upon which today's global financial markets operate.
?????Others disagree.
?????"There really isn't an example of where they've [price controls]=20
worked," said Robert Goldberg, a senior fellow at the National Center for=
=20
Policy Analysis, a nonpartisan think tank in New York.
?????"Controls always lead to an underproduction" of the commodity involved=
=20
because producers don't have any incentive to spend more on additional=20
output, he said. When the caps ultimately are lifted, prices typically soar=
=20
anyway as producers move to quickly recoup the profit they lost when the=20
controls were in place, Goldberg added.
?????Others note that although most of Nixon's price controls lasted only a=
=20
couple of years, various forms of controls over crude oil and natural gas=
=20
lasted for another decade until they were removed by President Ronald Reaga=
n.
?????In the meantime, the controls--aggravated by embargoes and other suppl=
y=20
cuts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries--distorted the fr=
ee=20
market for energy, critics say. The controls kept U.S. oil prices=20
artificially low, which in turn kept demand for oil high, giving OPEC more=
=20
power over world production and prices in the 1970s, they contend.
?????Nonetheless, proponents keep calling for controls when prices for=20
certain items seem to be spiraling out of control.

?????Critics Say Controls Worsen the Problems
?????President Clinton's massive health-reform proposal in the early 1990s=
=20
included price controls on drugs. But the idea set off howls of protest fro=
m=20
the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, and ultimately the entire=
=20
proposal was shelved. Consumer advocates and others also demanded federal=
=20
controls on rising cable TV rates in 1997 and 1998, again contending that t=
he=20
cable operators were hiking prices at a much faster rate than inflation.=20
Cable firms were allowed to keep passing certain costs on to their=20
subscribers, but specific price caps weren't enacted.
?????But proponents of temporary price controls on California power emphasi=
ze=20
that electricity isn't in the same category as an airplane seat, steel or=
=20
other commodities that don't have to be bought if the price soars too high.
?????"In soybeans maybe the market can adjust quickly" to changes in supply=
=20
and demand, "but in electric generation in California it can't," said Flori=
o,=20
who also serves as an attorney for the Utility Reform Network, a consumer=
=20
group. "For most products, one of the ways prices get determined is if buye=
rs=20
refuse to buy when the price gets too high. But that's generally not an=20
option for people when it comes to electricity."
?????Critics of California's attempt to cap prices last summer said the=20
controls instead prompted many power suppliers to sell their electricity to=
=20
other states. That "actually made the tight-supply problem worse [in=20
California] by driving imports out of the state," the Bay Area Economic=20
Forum, a research group funded by regional business and government agencies=
,=20
said in a report last week.
?????Indeed, the temporary caps were basically abandoned by year's end to=
=20
keep enough electricity in the state.
?????Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economics professor who heads the=
=20
Independent System Operator's market surveillance committee, said there are=
=20
ways to mitigate the state's power prices without having to set rigid=20
controls. One proposal: Have FERC require that generators supply 75% of the=
ir=20
expected future sales to California under long-term contracts at "just and=
=20
reasonable" prices set by the federal agency, he said.
?????That would "send the right [price] signal to suppliers to come into th=
e=20
state," Wolak said.
?????And because it will take time for California to get more of its own=20
power-generating plants up and running, the state's electricity crisis isn'=
t=20
unlike a natural disaster in which "normal public service is disrupted" and=
=20
short-term controls serve a purpose, Florio said.
?????"Over time, market forces will work" and controls shouldn't be need, h=
e=20
said. "But does that mean we're supposed to pay $10,000 per kilowatt-hour=
=20
until something gets done?"

Davis Names Executive to Speed Construction of Power Plants in State=20

Energy: Richard Sklar headed a building firm and worked for Clinton in=20
Bosnia. Governor sees the crisis abating by fall.=20

By DAN MORAIN, Times Staff Writer=20

?????SACRAMENTO--With temperatures rising and electrical supplies strained,=
=20
Gov. Gray Davis on Tuesday tapped a former Clinton administration official=
=20
and executives from major construction firms to help speed completion of=20
power plants.
?????Davis, who predicted that the worst of the energy crisis will abate by=
=20
the fall, announced that he has retained Richard Sklar, 67, former presiden=
t=20
of a construction firm, to head a team that will help accelerate the buildi=
ng=20
of power plants.
?????Speaking to business leaders at a California Chamber of Commerce=20
convention in Sacramento, Davis said Sklar's job will be "to make sure ther=
e=20
are no hurdles [and] to cut red tape."
?????"Richard Sklar knows electricity," Davis said. "He knows how to find=
=20
megawatts."
?????Former President Bill Clinton sent Sklar to the Balkans in 1996 to try=
=20
to help resolve the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Sklar arrived in Sarajevo to=
=20
find that power was on for only two hours a day and set about expanding=20
electricity generation.
?????In an interview, Sklar said his father was a mechanical engineer who=
=20
designed power stations.
?????"This power world is my world," Sklar said, adding that he had an=20
electric car and solar panels in the mid-1970s.
?????This Feb. 8, Davis announced at a news conference that he was appointi=
ng=20
Larry Hamlin, a vice president of Southern California Edison, as his=20
"construction czar." Hamlin's job was to speed power plant construction.
?????Davis spokesman Roger Salazar said that Hamlin's stint was temporary a=
nd=20
that the executive must return to Edison. Sklar's contract is for a longer=
=20
period, Salazar said, but it is unclear how long.
?????Sklar is being retained as a consultant, paid $100,000 initially. Othe=
r=20
firms, Salazar said, are loaning employees as volunteers. Joining Sklar wil=
l=20
be representatives of the engineering and construction firms Bechtel, URS=
=20
Corp. Engineering, Fluor Daniel, Parsons Brinckerhoff Quade & Douglas, and =
A.=20
Teichert & Sons. At least one Bechtel subsidiary is involved in power plant=
=20
construction in California.
?????"There is no conflict of interest," Sklar said, adding that no one in=
=20
the group will have authority to decide who gets contracts.
?????A mechanical engineer, Sklar was president of the San Francisco-based=
=20
construction management firm O'Brien Kreitzberg Inc. Sklar's firm also=20
oversaw construction of the Metro Rail Green Line in Los Angeles and the=20
rebuilding of the Los Angeles Central Library.
?????He was also chairman of the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission=
=20
under then-Mayor Dianne Feinstein. In that role, he oversaw rebuilding of t=
he=20
cable car system, completing the work ahead of schedule--in time for the 19=
84=20
Democratic National Convention there. Feinstein's husband is a major invest=
or=20
in URS, one of the firms that will loan employees to Sklar's team.
?????"He's very competent," said state Senate President Pro Tem John Burton=
=20
(D-San Francisco) of Sklar, whom he met in 1972. "He's a very good problem=
=20
solver and he brooks no nonsense. . . . He's a renaissance man. He loves=20
music, he loves politics and he's a gourmet cook."
?????Sklar has also displayed a sense of humor, once donating to San=20
Francisco Zoo two capybaras, rodents the size of a hog. He named one Quenti=
n=20
and the other Kopp, after a former San Francisco city supervisor and state=
=20
senator who is now a Superior Court judge.
?????"I'm 67; I've made all the money I need to make," said Sklar, who owns=
 a=20
vineyard near the Napa Valley town of Rutherford and has a home in San=20
Francisco.
?????"My reputation is what's going to be at stake in this, not the=20
governor's," he said. "I have a 40-year history of delivering--and that's=
=20
what I'm going to do. I don't like to lose."
?????As Davis announced Sklar's appointment, one of the governor's top ener=
gy=20
advisors, John Stevens, resigned, effective Friday. The governor praised=20
Stevens as a tireless worker.
?????Stevens worked on several energy-related tasks, among them Davis'=20
efforts to keep utilities out of bankruptcy. Davis appointed him for a day =
in=20
January to the state Public Utilities Commission, on which he cast a key vo=
te=20
to raise rates.
?????The state's power grid operators declared a Stage 2 emergency Tuesday=
=20
afternoon, as temperatures hit 90 degrees in downtown Los Angeles and two=
=20
major power plants in Southern California unexpectedly shut down. Power=20
reserves dropped to nearly 5%, below the minimum 7% that the California=20
Independent System Operator seeks to maintain.
?????Tuesday's emergency is not a predictor of worse electricity troubles t=
o=20
come, said Cal-ISO's Stephanie McCorkle, because an unusually high number o=
f=20
power plants are down for repairs that were planned months ago.
?????The plants not running Tuesday would be capable of supplying 10,000=20
megawatts, she said, or about a third of Tuesday's peak demand. By mid-June=
,=20
no power plants should be shut off for scheduled maintenance, McCorkle said=
.
?????The state will lose more than 1,000 megawatts of production starting=

this weekend when a unit of the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant near San=
=20
Luis Obispo is shut down for refueling. The shutdown, planned a year ago,=
=20
will last 35 days, according to Pacific Gas & Electric.
?????In his remarks Tuesday, Davis said his goal is to boost the state's=20
energy supply to exceed demand 15% by 2003.=20
?????"This is probably the most complicated challenge the state has faced i=

Power Plant Emits Tons of Fumes=20

Round-the-clock operation of old generators in Glendale and elsewhere=20
produces more than twice the old limits of pollution.=20

By JEAN GUCCIONE, Times Staff Writer=20

?????For the past five weeks, Glendale's Grayson power plant has been=20
belching a half-ton of pollutants into the air almost daily, more than twic=
e=20
previous limits.
?????The same is true for many of the other 14 power plants in Southern=20
California as the "haves" generate power, sometimes round-the-clock, for th=
e=20
"have-nots."
?????The generators, some of them nearly 50 years old and once considered t=
oo=20
dirty for regular use, now keep electricity flowing to fellow residents=20
around the state. And those living downwind are subjected to twice as much=
=20
air pollution as before California's energy crunch.
?????Not every Glendale resident is happy.
?????"You don't want anyone to get stuck with a rolling blackout, but we ge=
t=20
struck with the pollution," Jerold Petrosian said as he and his family boug=
ht=20
plants at a nursery across the street from the power plant. "It is a tough=
=20
decision."
?????Not so for Ignacio Troncoso, director of Glendale Water & Power. "Ther=
e=20
is a pretty decent trade-off, helping our neighbors in the state to keep=20
their lights on," he said.
?????A USC specialist warned that increased power plant emissions raise the=
=20
risks of asthma and other lung ailments in the young and old.
?????"There is a potential for more emergency room visits, more people seei=
ng=20
their doctors and more hospitalizations this summer," said Dr. Henry Gong,=
=20
professor of medicine and a specialist in the health effects of air polluti=
on.
?????With extended hours, the Glendale generators are emitting as much as 9=
95=20
pounds of pollutants into the air during peak demand, more than double the=
=20
old limit of 390 pounds a day, city and air-quality officials said.
?????The other 14 power plants in Southern California also have more than=
=20
doubled their overall emissions, according to preliminary figures from the=
=20
South Coast Air Quality Management District. As a group, the plants emitted=
 a=20
total of 2,045 tons of smog-forming nitrogen oxide in the first three month=
s=20
of 2001, compared with 905 tons for the same period last year.
?????The AQMD hearing board on Tuesday eased pollution controls so Glendale=
=20
may continue to generate excess electricity for sale to the energy-starved=
=20
state. Under the plan, Glendale may run three of its old steam boilers=20
around-the-clock to meet the state's energy demand. Usually, these boilers,=
=20
hidden behind a tall brick wall, sit idle except during the peak summer=20
demand because they are inefficient and costly.
?????Glendale, like Burbank and the Los Angeles Department of Water and=20
Power, continues to produce electricity at its city-owned plant. The three=
=20
cities opted against participating in a scheme of deregulation, a decision=
=20
that has shielded their residents, by and large, from the huge utility rate=
=20
hikes and rolling power outages experienced elsewhere. But they also will=
=20
contribute to easing the state's energy emergency in the dirtier air they=
=20
will be forced to breathe.
?????Air-quality officials said power plants contribute just about 3% of th=
e=20
900 tons of pollution emitted into the air daily, with about 70% of the=20
pollution coming from vehicles, not factories. And in recent years, many of=
=20
the region's municipal power generators have been updated with=20
pollution-control devices that reduce emissions.
?????Glendale's three steam generators, built between 1953 and 1963, are=20
inefficient by today's standards, but they are 85% cleaner since the city=
=20
pumped millions of dollars into upgrades. They will be even cleaner, city=
=20
officials say, with more retrofitting.
?????Under the plan, Glendale must reinvest profits from energy sales,=20
estimated at $3 million to $5 million this year, in equipment to reduce=20
future emissions at the plant and in community-based programs, such as mobi=
le=20
asthma clinics and programs to reduce school bus emissions.
?????The city plans to sell as much as 50 megawatts of power, enough to ser=
ve=20
50,000 homes. Under the decision Tuesday, pollution limits resume Jan. 1,=
=20
2002, or when the energy emergency ends.
?????In Los Angeles, power officials said they don't expect to exceed AQMD=
=20
caps, because they are adding pollution controls at two of the city's four=
=20
power plants. Although they will produce more electricity, they should not=
=20
produce any more nitrogen oxide, which in sunlight and heat form ozone, sai=
d=20
Angelina Galiteva, LADWP's director of strategic planning.
?????"We will have much cleaner equipment in place by June," she said.
?????Even the environmentalists are trying to balance the risks.
?????"We realize we have a problem this summer. We have to run these plants=
,"=20
said Sheryl Carter, a senior policy analyst for the National Resources=20
Defense Council.
?????Carter said natural-gas-powered generators, like the ones in Glendale,=
=20
are "a far superior solution to diesel generators," which produce 50 to 100=
=20
times the emissions and would be turned on in businesses across the state i=
f=20
energy is unavailable from other sources.
?????"We are trying to make sure the environment overall is made whole," sh=
e=20
said.
?????Carl Zichella, regional staff director for the Sierra Club, said the=
=20
generators should be run as a last resort. He also urged consumers to unplu=
g=20
spare refrigerators and use energy-efficient light bulbs to reduce the=20
state's overall energy demand.
?????"The only thing that is going to work to offset air pollution is=20
efficiency," he said. Otherwise, "we will pay not only with higher rates bu=
t=20
also with our health."
?????In neighboring Burbank, city officials are preparing for peak summer=

energy demands, when they expect to sell about 10% of their locally produce=

electricity outside the city.
?????"For four or five years, we have been polluting Utah, Arizona, Nevada,=

Washington and Oregon, importing power to Los Angeles," said Ron Davis,=20
general manager of Burbank Water & Power, listing the energy-producing stat=

that typically produce the bulk of Southern California's power. "We are=20
returning the favor."
?????Profits from those outside sales, Davis said, will help hold down=20

Power Plant Plan Worries Neighbors=20

Energy crisis: Regulators will decide next week whether to allow Huntington=
=20
Beach facility to boost output. Noise and pollution are concerns.=20

By CHRISTINE HANLEY, Times Staff Writer=20

?????On Hula Circle in Huntington Beach, families have tried to live with=
=20
their two very different neighbors. They live steps from the Pacific Ocean=
=20
but next door to the mechanical shrieks and foul smells of the massive AES=
=20
Corp. power plant.
?????But California's power crisis is rapidly unhinging life in the=20
neighborhood of ranch houses and bungalows.
?????State regulators will decide next week whether to allow the company to=
=20
double the plant's operations by July, providing much-needed electricity bu=
t=20
taking what residents fear will be a heavy toll on them.
?????It's one of several proposals to restart or build new power plants in=
=20
the wake of the power crisis using a "fast track" process that allows the=
=20
projects to go forward before environmental and pollution studies are=20
completed.
?????"The plant is so close. We want to know if it is impacting our kids in=
=20
ways we won't know about until 10 years from now," said Janette Mortimer, w=
ho=20
lives with her husband and their two young children in one of the homes=20
closest to the plant.
?????Already, residents say, the AES plant is casting a mightier shadow.=20
There are the ear-ringing rumbles and roars. There are the mysterious plume=
s=20
of smoke that waft over the neighborhood. Then there is the grime that seem=
s=20
never to go away.
?????If the California Energy Commission approves the permit for AES, the=
=20
facility could run at full capacity for the first time in memory. Officials=
=20
said the plant's previous owner, Southern California Edison, typically ran =
it=20
at 30% of capacity.
?????AES could be allowed to run the four gas-fired boilers and a "peaker"=
=20
unit whenever California hits a Stage 3 alert--which is expected to happen=
=20
often this summer. The "peaker" plant alone is powered by eight jet=20
engines--and sounds like it.
?????Currently, only two boilers are operating.
?????But residents say they are most worried about the air they breathe and=
=20
the water they swim in.
?????Under the fast-tracking process designed to get more electricity for t=
he=20
state as soon as possible, several key environmental questions have yet to =
be=20
studied.
?????Scientists studying the cause of ocean pollution that closed much of=
=20
Huntington Beach's shoreline in the summer of 1999 said that the plant, alo=
ng=20
with other factors, played a role by drawing partially treated sewage that =
is=20
discharged miles offshore back toward the coast.
?????AES Inc. will pay $1.5 million to further study the issue, but the=20
research won't be complete for some time.
?????"So much is uncertain," said Huntington Beach Councilwoman Shirley=20
Dettloff. "These are big, big things."
?????For now, residents say they are bracing for more noise, smoke and=20
disruption.
?????To begin with, AES' proposal calls for 20 hours a day of nonstop=20
construction to get the two mothballed generators in service by July.
?????Then there are the sizzling summer temperatures. Residents usually ope=
n=20
their windows to let the ocean breezes cool their homes. But the noise and=
=20
smells from the plants may make that impossible.
?????"It's going to be bad. There's no escape," said Bryan Visnoski.
?????The plant has towered over the Huntington Beach coastline for nearly 4=
0=20
years. The housing tracts came later, but most inhabitants of Hula Circle a=
nd=20
surrounding streets seemed to make peace with their industrial neighbor.
?????Some have installed double-paned windows to dampen the sound. Others=
=20
have remodeled their homes to obstruct ugly views. The Mortimers grew tall=
=20
trees and trained vines past the windows.

Federal plan called 'too little, too late'=20
Limited price control seen as step in right direction, but officials renew=

As federal energy regulators consider a plan intended to ease the state's=
=20
worsening energy crisis, California officials and some energy experts are=
=20
already criticizing it as inadequate.=20
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is scheduled today to debate a=20
proposal that would force power generators to sell electricity at a=20
discounted price to California during severe power emergencies.=20
The proposal would require producers to sell energy to the state's power gr=
id=20
during Stage 3 emergencies. Stage 3 emergencies are declared when energy=20
resources are almost depleted, allowing utilities to cut off power to=20
customers at any time.=20
The plan also would limit how much energy firms could profit off such sales=
.=20
But Gov. Gray Davis and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, among others, say stronger=
=20
remedies -- including the temporary regional price limits they have advocat=
ed=20
for months -- are needed to stave off a summer of blackouts and power=20
shortages.=20
"I think the plan before FERC is too little, too late," Davis said yesterda=
y=20
in Sacramento.=20
"We need help all the time. The regulatory commission plan excludes 95=20
percent of the purchases of power. A Stage 3 situation is, by definition,=
=20
chaotic as we scramble to find the megawatts to keep the lights on."=20
The commission ordered its staff in December to come up with remedies to=20
California's energy woes. The commissioners are expected to make their=20
decision by May 1, a self-imposed deadline to help the Golden State.=20
The proposal to be debated today would require producers to sell electricit=
y=20
to California at a price based on the costs of the least-efficient plant=20
providing the energy. More efficient plants sending energy to the state wou=
ld=20
still be able to make a sizable profit.=20
The plan has also drawn criticism because it applies only to California, no=
t=20
other Western states that are also feeling the pinch of higher energy price=
s.=20
But California officials say the proposal does signal a shift in the hard-=
=20
line position of the commission's majority against any form of price=20
controls. The plan would set some form of price ceiling, even if only durin=
g=20
extreme conditions.=20
In regulatory commission documents, the plan is referred to as "price=20
mitigation" -- not price limits.=20
"I sincerely don't believe that FERC would even be considering the Stage 3 =
if=20
it were not for us making substantial noise about a temporary cap," said=20
Feinstein, D-Calif., who introduced a bill with other Western senators=20
yesterday to require the agency to impose temporary price controls on energ=
y=20
sold to Western states.=20
Severin Borenstein, director of the University of California Energy=20
Institute, said the regulatory commission has yet to make a compelling case=
=20
for why its "Stage 3" plan would help lower sky-high prices.=20
"The argument being made to support this is that firms are only able to=20
exercise market power during Stage 3 emergencies," Borenstein said. "And th=
e=20
evidence is quite clear that's just not true.=20
"It's unfortunate that FERC thinks this is solving some problem for=20
California, because it won't."=20

S&P lowers California's bond rating=20
First cut since '94 could cost taxpayers millions=20

Citing the "rapidly escalating uncertainty" surrounding the power crisis,=
=20
Standard & Poor's slashed California's credit rating yesterday for the firs=
t=20
time since 1994, when the state was still climbing out of a recession.=20
The downgrade -- and the energy debacle that led up to it -- will cost=20
taxpayers tens or hundreds of millions of dollars a year by raising the=20
state's borrowing costs. Investors will probably see the market price of=20
California municipal bonds and bond funds decline further.=20
But the biggest blow may be to the state's ego. S&P downgraded the state's=
=20
general obligation bonds two notches -- to A+ from AA. The only other state=
=20
currently rated A+ is Hawaii. The only state with a lower credit rating is=
=20
Louisiana, according to S&P.=20
Most states are rated AA. Some states don't have a credit rating because th=
ey=20
don't have bonds.=20
California's credit rating is still "investment grade," which means it is n=
ot=20
expected to default on its bonds. However, the state's ability to repay its=
=20
debt "isn't as strong as it used to be," said Steve Zimmermann, a managing=
=20
director with Standard & Poor's. "This is a very speculative situation."=20
States hire companies like S&P to give them an independent credit rating wh=
en=20
they borrow money by selling bonds. The rating reflects the state's ability=
=20
to repay its debt in full, on time.=20
When they sell new bonds, states with lower credit ratings usually pay high=
er=20
interest than higher-rated states, to make up for the added risk.=20
A rating change does not affect the interest rate states pay on bonds that=
=20
have already been issued, but it can affect the price of bonds when they=20
trade on the open market among investors.=20
Yesterday's downgrade "reflects the mounting and uncertain cost to the stat=
e=20
of the current electrical power crisis, as well as its likely long-term=20
detrimental effect on the state's economy," S&P said in a news release.=20
"Given the large magnitude of the problem in relation to the size of fund=
=20
balances the state typically budgets, the capacity to pay debt service, whi=
le=20
still adequate, has been reduced."=20
In January, S&P placed the state's debt on "CreditWatch with negative=20
implications," a signal that it might lower the rating.=20
In an unusual move, S&P kept the state on CreditWatch after yesterday's=20
downgrade, which means the rating could fall even lower.=20
Zimmermann said S&P is keeping California on CreditWatch pending its abilit=
y=20
to sell $10 billion to $14 billion worth of bonds to reimburse the state's=
=20
general fund for past and future power purchases.=20
"If they did the bond issue, they'd replenish the fund, at least for the=20
short term. If they don't do it, then it's more of a concern," Zimmermann=
=20
said.=20
Unfortunately, the downgrade could make it harder for the state to sell the=
=20
bonds.=20
"If they could have gotten the deal done before the downgrade, they would=
=20
have had a stronger deal," said Kelly Mainelli, a municipal bond fund manag=
er=20
with Montgomery Asset Management.=20
California must obtain an investment-grade rating (BBB- or higher) on the=
=20
bonds before it can sell them.=20
Mainelli said California municipal bond prices have already fallen in=20
anticipation of a ratings cut. When prices fall, bond yields go up.=20
"The downgrade is the culmination of everything that's happened since early=
=20
December," he said.=20
In November, California municipal bonds yields were 0.4 to 0.5 percentage=
=20
points below the national average. Today, they're 0.1 to 0.2 percentage=20
points above the national average, and Mainelli thinks they could go up 0.1=
=20
to 0.2 percentage points more because of the downgrade.=20
The total difference -- about 0.7 percentage points -- doesn't sound like=
=20
much, but it adds up.=20
Last year, the state itself sold $4.6 billion in new bonds (excluding bonds=
=20
sold to replace existing bonds). If it sells the same amount this year, plu=
s=20
$12 billion in energy bonds, that 0.7 percentage point difference on $16.6=
=20
billion in bonds would cost the state $116 million a year in additional=20
interest costs.=20
Yesterday's downgrade only affected the state's general obligation bonds an=
d=20
others secured by the "full faith and credit of the state," such as the=20
California Health Facilities Construction Loan Insurance Fund (Cal Mortgage=
).=20
But the energy debacle could wind up costing other municipal bond issuers i=
n=20
California -- such as cities, counties, school and water districts -- more=
=20
money when they sell bonds. Although their ratings have not changed because=
=20
of the energy crisis, analysts say the yields on most California municipal=
=20
bonds have gone up, and will go up some more, as a result of the state's=20
downgrade.=20
"The values of all California bonds will be hurt by this downgrade, whether=
=20
they should be or not. Psychologically, it's just how the market reacts,"=
=20
says Richard Goldstein, a San Ramon financial planner.=20
Investors who have to sell their California bonds on the open market before=
=20
they mature may not get all their principal back. But investors who hold=20
their bonds until maturity will probably get paid in full, Goldstein said.=
=20
No matter how bad the energy crisis gets, most experts believe the state wi=
ll=20
continue making principal and interest payments on its bonds, even if it ha=
s=20
to raise taxes, cut expenditures or run a temporary deficit to do so.=20
"There's also the prospect at some point of federal help," Goldstein said.=
=20
"The federal government does not want California to default or even come=20
close.=20
Do you know what that would do to the national economy and the world=20
economy?"=20
California's bond-rating history=20
S&P cut its rating on California debt yesterday for the first time since=20
1994.=20
What credit ratings mean=20
-- AAA: Extremely strong capacity to meet financial commitments.=20
-- AA: Very strong capacity to meet financial commitments.=20
-- A: Strong capacity to meet financial commitments but somewhat more=20
susceptible to adverse circumstances and economic conditions.=20
-- BBB: Adequate capacity to meet financial commitments. However, adverse=
=20
economic conditions could weaken ability to pay debts.=20
Note: Ratings below BBB are considered poor investment risks, and the issue=
s=20
sometimes are called "junk bonds."=20

Will price caps deter investment, as federal regulators say?=20

343EDT0117.DTL=20
(04-25) 00:43 PDT SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Some key power generators say=20
California's dearth of energy supplies, and its growing demand, make it a=
=20
good place to build more plants and sell more power in the years to come --=
=20
even if dreaded price caps are imposed.=20
``Regardless of what the (market) structure turns out to be, the state's=20
going to need electricity and it's going to need to buy it from somebody,''=
=20
said Bill Highlander, spokesman for San Jose-based Calpine Corp.=20
Calpine is investing about $4 billion in power plants over the next four=20
years that will generate 9,000 megawatts, enough for more than 6 million=20
homes. The state's current energy crisis ``hasn't really changed our plans =
or=20
our strategy,'' he said.=20
But Chief federal energy regulator Curtis Hebert says price caps on wholesa=
le=20
electricity will hinder, not help, California's energy crisis.=20
Energy wholesalers seeking higher prices than California is willing to pay=
=20
will invest in other states, warns Hebert, the chairman of the Federal Ener=
gy=20
Regulatory Commission. And any regulations that cut into future profits wil=
l=20
scare away desperately needed new power plants, he says.=20
Eight of the 13 new power plants approved in California already are under=
=20
construction. Twelve more are under review, according to the California=20
Energy Commission, which approves power plants.=20
CEC spokesman Rob Schlichting said that's a huge boost over the last decade=
,=20
when uncertainty over the rules of deregulation -- not a threat of price ca=
ps=20
-- kept applications down. No companies have withdrawn plans to build plant=
s=20
since December.=20
``The only way price caps would scare away investment is if they were set s=
o=20
low you couldn't make a profit,'' Schlichting said. ``It's still a market=
=20
that people seem to want to come in and produce power for.''=20
Other companies still planning to invest in California include North=20
Carolina-based Duke Energy, which has two plants in the works, and=20
Houston-based Reliant Energy, which is negotiating with the state to sell=
=20
power on long-term contracts.=20
Reliant's spokesman, Richard Wheatley, wouldn't say whether price caps alon=
e=20
would inhibit them from building more plants. What he did say is that=20
California's power politics leave a lot of room for improvement.=20
The state has considered taking over power plants through eminent domain an=
d=20
implementing a windfall profits tax to take some of their earnings away.=20
Meanwhile, Attorney General Bill Lockyer is offering a bounty for any=20
information that could prove wholesalers worked together to drive up prices=
,=20
which could lead to more lawsuits and investigations.=20
If California wants to encourage construction, it's got to tone down its=20
vilification and stop adding more restrictions, Wheatley said.=20
``Whenever we go into an area and consider building a power plant, we have =
to=20
look at the economics of the facility, we have to look at the regulatory=20
situation, esoteric things like what the mindset is like,'' he said.=20
``California is not the easiest place in which to do business.''=20
Some power companies have invested so much in pipelines, gas reserves and=
=20
plants already under construction that it's folly to turn back now.=20
``We want to build in California, but we need to have regulatory stability =
or=20
at least regulatory clarity to move these things forward because they're=20
half-billion dollar projects in some cases,'' said Tom Williams, a spokesma=
n=20
for Duke. ``That's a lot of bananas.''=20
Senators Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Gordon Smith, R-Ore., plan this we=
ek=20
to introduce legislation urging FERC to impose a temporary price cap over t=
he=20
11 Western states. They hope to keep prices down in the short-term and give=
=20
California and other troubled states a breather to make long-term decisions=
.=20
Feinstein's bill does not yet specify a price. Some economists say $150 to=
=20
$250 per megawatt hour would be just and reasonable, yet provide generators=
 a=20
profit. Prices have gone as high as $1,500 for the same amount of power in=
=20
the past year.=20
Tying the price cap to the cost of making power could make it easier for=20
generators to swallow, said Severin Borenstein, director of the University =
of=20
California, Berkeley's energy institute. Such a cap would account for=20
variables such as the wildly fluctuating cost of natural gas used to genera=
te=20
much of the energy in California's power plants.=20
Price caps can be effective, but only if they are very carefully designed,=
=20
warned Frank Wolak, chairman of the Independent System Operator's market=20
surveillance committee. The ISO manages the state's power grid.=20
Set them too high, and companies will only bid that amount, saving little=
=20
money, Wolak said. Too low, and the generators could choose to sell elsewhe=
re=20
unless all other nearby states have the same price limits.=20
Also, capping the most expensive energy sales -- power sold on the spot=20
market at times of high demand -- won't lower prices for other key componen=
ts=20
of the state's energy supply, such as electricity bought for the next day's=
=20
power needs.=20
``Suppose you're paying $150 every single (megawatt) hour. That still puts =
us=20
in big trouble with wholesale energy costs,'' Wolak said.=20
The state already has spent $5.1 billion buying power for customers of=20
California's three largest investor-owned utilities, which lost their credi=
t=20
-- and thus their ability to buy power -- after paying sharply higher costs=
=20
for wholesale energy.=20
Borenstein said paying even $250 a megawatt hour is still preferable to the=
=20
unknown, particularly since economists have warned that there is virtually =
no=20
upper limit to what energy companies can charge.=20
``This summer we are going to be truly short of power and at those times th=
e=20
price is going to be at the price cap, and if we don't have a price cap, th=
ey=20
will be way above the price cap,'' Borenstein said.=20
FERC remains opposed to price caps, but after months of complaints, the boa=
rd=20
this week is considering a limited cap on the most expensive last-minute=20
power buys.=20
The proposal would cap California but not the rest of the West, and order=
=20
wholesalers to sell to the state during the most extreme power shortages.=
=20
Though it provides some cushioning, it does not address the high prices=20
California swallows the rest of the time. That's the point of Feinstein's=
=20
bill.=20
``The crisis point is this summer to next summer and we need some federal=
=20
assistance,'' said Howard Gantman, spokesman for Feinstein. ``This would=20
assure the generators a reasonable profit and continue to spur on further=
=20
investment into new plants.''=20

(04-25) 02:52 PDT SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- A major credit rating agency h=
as=20
downgraded California's state bonds, citing the financial drain from the=20
continuing energy crisis.=20
``The downgrade reflects the mounting and uncertain cost to the state of th=
e=20
current electrical power crisis, as well as its likely long-term detrimenta=
l=20
effect on the state's economy,'' Standard & Poors said Tuesday.=20
The state's ability to repay its debts, while still considered adequate, ha=
s=20
been reduced, S&P said in dropping the rating on California's general=20
obligation bonds by two notches from AA to A+. It similarly revised other=

lease ratings, and ratings for the California Health Facilities Constructio=
n=20
Loan Insurance Fund, known as Cal Mortgage.=20
S&P is one of three major rating agencies watching the state's financial=20
performance. Credit ratings help determine how much states and other=20
borrowers must pay when issuing bonds. The lower the rating, the higher the=

interest rate the state must pay to attract bond investors.=20

State bond rating lowered=20
Posted at 10:53 p.m. PDT Tuesday, April 24, 2001=20
BY JENNIFER BJORHUS=20

Mercury News=20


One of Wall Street's top credit-rating houses has downgraded California's=
=20
bonds because of the state's handling of the energy crisis, a move that cou=
ld=20
ultimately cost taxpayers tens of millions of dollars.=20
Saying that mounting and uncertain power costs are likely to do lasting har=
m=20
to California's economy, New York-based Standard & Poor's on Tuesday lowere=
d=20
the state's credit rating on its ``general obligation'' bonds two notches,=
=20
from AA to A+ with a negative outlook. That puts California near the bottom=
=20
of the state bond heap with only one state -- Louisiana -- rated lower.=20
Standard & Poor's said the rating could go lower if the state cannot resolv=
e=20
the power crisis.=20
The downgrade will cost California millions of dollars in coming years=20
because a lower rating makes it more expensive for the state to issue gener=
al=20
obligation bonds to finance projects such as school construction.=20
The interest on those bonds, which will rise from an estimated 5 to perhaps=
=20
5.25 percent, is paid from the state's tax-financed general fund. Although=
=20
the rating change doesn't apply technically to the different type of bond t=
he=20
state plans to issue by June for power purchases, it will probably make tho=
se=20
bonds more expensive for the state, too, bond experts say.=20
Heightened urgency=20
``There's a sense of urgency that this problem has been escalating,=20
particularly since the PG&E bankruptcy,'' said David Hitchcock, California=
=20
analyst for Standard & Poor's. ``This problem could move quickly.''=20
At least one bond expert said the downgrade was surprising.=20
``To me it's clear that S&P doesn't have much faith in this power-bailout=
=20
plan of the Legislature and the governor. To me that's the reason they did=
=20
it,'' said Zane Mann, publisher of the monthly California Bond Advisor=20
newsletter.=20
No single new piece of information triggered the downgrade, Hitchcock said.=
=20
The major factor, he said, was simply spiraling costs and no long-term plan=
=20
for paying the bills. Last week Gov. Gray Davis said the state had been=20
spending $73 million a day to buy electricity, up from $45.8 million a day =
in=20
late March. Hitchcock said some energy traders suspect the actual costs are=
=20
higher.=20
All three major Wall Street credit-rating agencies have California on=20
so-called ``credit watch,'' but only Standard & Poor's has downgraded. One=
=20
municipal bond expert said Standard & Poor's had been ``trigger happy'' and=
=20
eager to downgrade. Raymond Murphy, Moody's California analyst, said he had=
=20
no immediate plans to change California's bond rating, but that he's anxiou=
s=20
to see officials produce a long-term plan for financing power purchases.=20
Murphy said he had a conference call with state officials about the issue=
=20
Tuesday morning.=20
``We want the state to develop the plan that gets the general fund out of=
=20
power purchasing,'' Murphy said.=20
The state says it's working on that, but there's a roadblock.=20
Revenue bonds=20
A major piece of the state's plan is to have the Department of Water=20
Resources issue $10 billion to $14 billion in revenue bonds to pay back the=
=20
general fund for what has been taken to buy power in recent months. But tha=
t=20
portion of the plan is tied up in a dispute between PG&E and the California=
=20
Public Utilities Commission over how to spend the extra money generated by=
=20
electricity rate increases. The dispute has also held up the $4.13 billion =
in=20
financing the state had arranged to pay down the advances it took out of th=
e=20
general fund to buy power.=20
To break the logjam, officials from the state treasurer's office have asked=
=20
lawmakers to pass emergency legislation to allow the state to issue the=20
revenue bonds.=20
``California's credit rating and financial strength will be in jeopardy unt=
il=20
the state's general fund is repaid for energy costs,'' state Treasurer Phil=
ip=20
Angelides said in a statement Tuesday.=20
State Finance Director Tim Gage and Gov. Davis both downplayed the=20
significance of the rate change. Through a press officer, Davis said the=20
state's economy remains fundamentally strong.=20
The state was downgraded to a lower A rating in 1994 and went on to see=20
tremendous economic growth.=20
Mounting pressure=20
Still, a downgrade is bad news that sends a psychological signal in both th=
e=20
finance and real worlds. Some industry watchers said they hope the downgrad=
e=20
pushes lawmakers and state officials, whom they perceive to be too slow in=
=20
responding to the crisis.=20
``It sounds like the bond market might be out ahead of some of the=20
policy-makers in California,'' said Severin Borenstein, director of the=20
University of California Energy Institute. ``We're facing a real emergency=
=20
here.''=20
John Hallacy, managing director of municipal research at Merrill Lynch, sai=
d=20
a lower credit rating puts more pressure on the state to issue the revenue=
=20
bonds fast, and to conserve cash.=20
``We're kind of at the critical juncture now where the pieces are still all=
=20
over the floor,'' Hallacy said of the state's efforts to build and approve =
a=20
long-term solution to the power crisis.=20
To Nettie Hoge, executive director of the Utility Reform Network and a=20
leading critic of the state's efforts to bail out PG&E and Southern=20
California Edison, the downgrade means ``the analysts are watching.'' She=
=20
said she hopes that President Bush and the Federal Energy Regulatory=20
Commission are watching, too.=20
``Hopefully, this is a wake-up call for FERC. Those guys could solve this i=
n=20
a nanosecond,'' Hoge said. ``This is just another milepost on the downward=
=20
spiral to economic catastrophe.''=20

Q&A with Gov. Gray Davis on energy issues=20
Gov. Gray Davis visited the Mercury News editorial board Monday. On the=20
subject of electricity, Davis talked about increasing the number of power=
=20
plants, the rejection of price caps by the Federal Energy Regulatory=20
Commission, and the condition of the state's two largest utilities, Souther=
n=20
California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric. Davis has proposed a deal to=
=20
rescue Edison, and the Legislature is considering it. PG&E has filed for=20
bankruptcy.=20
Here is a condensed version of Davis' remarks.=20
Q: What would you like to say by way of introduction about the state's=20
electricity problems?=20
Davis: There are really two problems. One is the amount of power available=
=20
and the other is the price of power.=20
In 2002, we'll have more megawatts on line, at least 5,000 more. By 2003,=
=20
we'll have a slight excess of power over demand. That's very important.=20
Because at the moment, we import 20 percent of our power. We have no=20
leverage. We are at the mercy of forces that show no mercy. That will never=
=20
change until we have more power than we need.=20
OK, price. As you know, the only entity that can influence the [wholesale]=
=20
price of electricity is the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.=20
Deregulation surrendered the ability of the state to do that.=20
In 1999, this state for all power, including municipal power, spent roughly=
=20
$7 billion. In 2000, we spent $32.5 billion. I don't know what it will be=
=20
this year, but it will be substantially higher.=20
Through all this the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has refused to do=
 a=20
thing, zero, zippo. Lest you think I'm being partisan, that commission=20
consists entirely of Clinton appointees.=20
The final piece is the financial consequences of what's happened to date. I=
t=20
is our hope that if we can keep Southern California Edison credit-worthy an=
d=20
able to re-enter the power purchasing market Jan. 1, 2003, we can then go t=
o=20
the PG&E creditors committee [the generators to whom PG&E owes money] and s=
ay=20
to them: ``Look at the arrangement we made with Southern California Edison.=
=20
We believe that this is a far better deal than PG&E can give you.''=20
I think this is a fair plan. We get every electron that Edison's utility ow=
ns=20
committed for 10 years, at a cost-of-service basis. Under [current law] the=
y=20
could sell that next March at market rates. We got $400 million returned fr=
om=20
the holding company, a $3 billion investment in the transmission and delive=
ry=20
systems .?.?. a permanent easement on about 20,000 acres of environmental=
=20
property around all their hydro facilities.=20
Q: Do you have in mind a finished product for the changes that are happenin=
g=20
in the electric system? What will it look like in a couple of years?=20
Davis: It is my expectation that the utilities will be purchasing the power=
=20
entirely, commencing Jan. 1, 2003. Our goal is to get them back in business=
.=20
In addition to investor-owned utilities, I believe we also need a public=20
power authority. At some point I believe the private sector will say to=20
itself, ``I want to build new plants to replace the 40-year-old plants, but=
=20
do I really want to get the state to a 15 percent margin over supply, there=
by=20
reducing the value of the electrons I already own?'' If they do, God bless=
=20
them. But if they don't, at least we'll have the opportunity to build them=
=20
ourselves.=20
Once we have even a slight margin of capacity over demand, the spot market=
=20
prices will come down dramatically.=20
Q: You said in February that you could have solved the electricity problem =
in=20
20 minutes if you'd been willing to raise rates. Now, rates are going to be=
=20
raised. Should you have favored a rate increase earlier?=20
Davis: I should have been more specific. I should have said I could have=20
solved it in 20 minutes if I wanted to triple rates. I think the rate=20
increase I proposed is fair. It rewards people who are the most energy=20
efficient, the people who only use up to 130 percent of their baseline. The=
y=20
are approximately half the state. So half the state will see no rate=20
increase, beyond the 10 percent that everyone saw in January.=20
Q: Is the state willing to spend anything it costs to keep the lights on, o=
r=20
at some point, would it stiff the generators and just say we will accept a=
=20
blackout?=20
Davis: We have to provide power. There are many people who have medical=20
devices that have to keep running. Blackouts can cause deaths, traffic=20
accidents, all kinds of calamities that I wouldn't want to happen.=20
I'm reluctant to tell the generators we'll pay any price, so I'm not going =
to=20
say we'll pay absolutely any price, but my bias obviously is to find a way =
to=20
keep the lights on.=20
Q: When will you reveal how much electricity the state has bought, from wha=
t=20
companies, at what prices and what this will cost the state this year and i=
n=20
coming years?=20
Davis: We'll reveal an awful lot of information as soon as the bonds go to=
=20
market. [The state plans a bond issue to cover the upfront costs of=20
purchasing electricity.] That information has to be made public. That will=
=20
probably be in less than two months.=20
Believe me, I don't like going around getting beat up for hiding informatio=
n.=20
I'm doing it for one reason only, which is that I know every additional edg=
e=20
I give the generators will result in higher prices for customers.=20
Q: There's an impression that the state budget is being drained by the powe=
r=20
crisis. Is that right?=20
Davis: The simple answer to that is no, because the state will be fully=20
reimbursed with interest as soon as these bonds are sold.=20
At the moment, in the short term, it is crowding out other spending. But I=
=20
think everyone understands that's a temporary phenomenon, until the state i=
s=20
reimbursed by bonds that are repaid over time through the rate structure th=
at=20
I proposed.=20
Q: Would it be your pledge that ratepayers, not taxpayers, will fully repay=
=20
the state's cost in purchasing electricity?=20
Davis: That is the assumption underlying these bonds. That's right as it=20
relates to electricity, but obviously the conservation incentives came out =
of=20
the general fund.=20
Q: Have you talked to President Bush about this?=20
Davis: I hear all these rumors as to why the Bush administration doesn't wa=
nt=20
to be helpful, but this state, and particularly this region, has been=20
disproportionately helpful in America's economic growth and technological=
=20
productivity. If he wants America to grow, it behooves him to keep Californ=
ia=20
growing. To date, I think it's fair to say that of my public requests,=20
President Bush has been responsive to all but the price caps.=20

Davis: Power surplus by 2003=20
Published Wednesday, April 25, 2001, in the San Jose Mercury News=20
BY DON THOMPSON=20

Associated Press=20


SACRAMENTO -- Even as power grid operators warned the state's lights could=
=20
flicker again by week's end, Gov. Gray Davis on Tuesday pledged that=20
Californians will be wallowing in electricity by the end of 2003.=20
Davis compared the emergency to fighting a large forest fire -- in a few=20
years, the fire will be out and the state will be out of the energy-buying=
=20
business.=20
Just in case Davis' plans fail, however, an Assembly task force is=20
considering options, including having the state buy Southern California=20
Edison.=20
Critics have hammered Davis for his handling of the power crisis, and his=
=20
predictions have faltered before.=20
In January, Davis set three goals as energy prices spiraled upward and shor=
t=20
supply endangered the state's large investor-owned utilities: to avoid=20
blackouts, bankruptcies and rate increases.=20
All three have since happened.=20
On Tuesday, Davis lowered the bar substantially: ``If the lights stay on, w=
e=20
will have succeeded. Our goal is to keep the power flowing in this state, t=
o=20
avoid blackouts, to moderate the price increases in a fair and reasonable w=
ay=20
and reward those who conserve the most, and to chart a steady course.''=20
Even keeping the lights on may be difficult as temperatures climb this week=
,=20
warned the Independent System Operator, which runs the state's power grid.=
=20
The ISO declared a Stage 2 emergency Tuesday afternoon when the state came=
=20
within 5 percent of running out of electricity after two power plants went=
=20
off-line unexpectedly.=20
Spring's first warm spell is likely to boost demand by 2,000 megawatts -- t=
he=20
equivalent of two large power plants able to power 1.5 million homes -- the=
=20
ISO said in calling for more energy conservation.=20
The increase comes as hydroelectric power runs low across the dry Northwest=
,=20
and as 13,000 megawatts of power remain unavailable due to planned or=20
unplanned plant shutdowns.=20
Davis insisted that statewide conservation this summer can stave off=20
widespread blackouts as the state rushes to build its way out of the supply=
=20
shortage.=20
``At the end of 2003 we will have more power than we need, we will have=20
regained control of our energy destiny,'' Davis promised in a speech to the=
=20
California Chamber of Commerce. ``By the end of 2003 you can have all the=
=20
appliances on. You can, you know, don't turn anything off, you can just=20
luxuriate in all your electricity.''=20
Davis promised a 15 percent supply surplus by 2004.=20
To that end, he named former diplomat Richard Sklar to head a new=20
``generation implementation task force'' of business consultants charged wi=
th=20
speeding up power plant siting and construction. Before entering public=20
service, Sklar was president of San Francisco-based construction machinery=
=20
manufacturer O'Brien Kreitzberg.=20
Standard and Poors dropped California's credit rating Tuesday, warning that=
=20
continued purchases could hurt the state treasury.

State's bond rating is lowered=20
The energy crisis brings an A+ designation, which likely will mean higher=
=20
borrowing costs.=20
April 25, 2001=20
By JOHN HOWARD
The Orange County Register=20
SACRAMENTO California's electricity crisis prompted a top credit agency to=
=20
downgrade the state's credit rating by two notches to its lowest level in=
=20
seven years. The move is likely to force the state to pay millions of dolla=
rs=20
more in interest when it borrows.=20
"It's a statement from Wall Street to California to get your act together,"=
=20
said Assemblyman George Runner, R-Lancaster, a GOP energy- finance expert i=
n=20
the Assembly.=20
"The ratings action is serious and should be a warning to the state that it=
=20
is on the wrong course," added Mark McCray, a municipal-bonds manager at=20
Newport Beach-based Pimco. "This downgrade will cost the state a lot in ter=
ms=20
of increased financing and costs until, if ever, it is upgraded."=20
Standard and Poor's Corp., concerned about the $5 billion drained from the=
=20
state's coffers to buy power this year, cut California's credit rating from=
=20
AA to A+. The reduction applies to voter-approved bonds, called general=20
obligation, or G.O., bonds, that typically provide funds for schools, parks=
,=20
water projects and highways.=20
About $19.3 billion worth of G.O. bonds have been approved by voters. About=
=20
$12 billion have not yet been sold.=20
The credit-rating cut would force the state to pay higher interest rates to=
=20
attract buyers to the unsold bonds. If the state were to sell all $12 billi=
on=20
under the lower credit rating, it could be forced to pay an additional $190=
=20
million to $500 million annually in interest, depending on market condition=
s.=20
Shortly after Standard and Poor's announcement, state Treasurer Phil=20
Angelides urged lawmakers to limit the size of the state's looming=20
electricity-bond sale to $10 billion - or $2.4 billion less than Gov. Gray=
=20
Davis wants.=20
Angelides said capping the revenue bond at $10 billion would head off legal=
=20
challenges from utilities, expedite the passage of the bond plan through th=
e=20
Legislature and allow the sale to go forward.=20
"At a minimum, we need an authorization of $10 billion," Angelides said. If=
=20
Davis and lawmakers want more, they should do it later, Angelides added.=20
Davis has sought $12.4 billion. The rift between the governor and the=20
treasurer, both Democrats, marks their sharpest political divergence since=
=20
the energy crisis erupted last year.=20
A Davis spokesman declined to comment on the difference. "We are working wi=
th=20
the treasurer and others to draft legislation for that bond bill, and we'll=
=20
continue to work with him," said Roger Salazar.=20
The Davis administration hopes to raise the money by selling revenue bonds,=
=20
backed by a charge on consumers' utility bills. The sale had been planned f=
or=20
May but has since been pushed back to June or July at the earliest.=20
But there is a clock ticking: The state has been spending $45 million to $6=
0=20
million a day for electricity. The longer the delay in selling the bonds, t=
he=20
less money will be available to buy cheaper energy for the state under=20
long-term contracts.=20
Before funding future power purchases, the bond proceeds must go to pay bac=
k=20
the $5 billion the state has spent on electricity purchased since January o=
n=20
behalf of California's three big cash-strapped utilities.=20
While the Standard and Poor's downgrade won't directly affect the electrici=
ty=20
bonds, since they won't be G.O. bonds, it does reflect Wall Street's concer=
n=20
about the unstanched outflow of state funds.=20
"In my mind there's no doubt that S&P is doing this because they simply don=
't=20
have faith in the proposed bailout and what the state is going to have to g=
o=20
through to solve its power problems,' said Zane Mann, the editor of a=20
newsletter that tracks California's general-obligation bonds.=20
Mann said the A+ rating puts California "below average" nationally. The=20
rating downgrade sliced the value of an existing 30-year California G.O. bo=
nd=20
by 3.5 percent, he said. But since most investors who buy California bonds=
=20
hold them to maturity, Mann said the losses would be largely confined to=20
paper.=20
Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, who authored the bill that=20
authorized the power bonds, said the sale should be limited to the $10=20
billion originally provided for in the bill. The bill provides for the=20
utilities to forward money collected from ratepayers to the state Departmen=
t=20
of Water Resources, which purchases the power.=20
As the state spent more than anticipated on emergency electricity purchases=
,=20
Davis sought to increase the size of the bond sale. But that suggestion has=
=20
led the utilities to challenge the bill's rate- diversion mechanism, which=
=20
has "put a cloud on our ability to acquire financing," Keeley said.=20
Assembly Republican Leader Dave Cox of Fair Oaks said he would strongly=20
support any move to cap the amount of borrowing the state would do to buy=

electricity.=20

Power Companies and Regulators Must Take Steps To Avoid Spread of=20
California Power Virus/ Andersen Analysis



WASHINGTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 24, 2001 via NewsEdge Corporation  -
A "new virus spawned
in California" poses formidable challenges requiring new strategies on
the part of power companies, regulators and policymakers to contain
and reverse its damage, according to "Energy Crisis in the Western
United States: Lessons for Navigating Regulatory and Market
Minefields," a new Andersen report released today.


"The implications for the development of competitive energy
markets go far beyond the Western United States," Andersen's national
utility practice head Matthew D. Smith told a Washington briefing.
"Unfortunately, California has taught the nation that regulatory and
political barriers can create and sustain an energy crisis."


"California has demonstrated that the risks in the electricity
industry, if not properly acknowledged and managed, can simultaneously
and profoundly impact all market participants. To be effectively
managed, these risks need to be exposed, assumed or shared, measured
and monitored. When they are hidden or ignored, all parties can
potentially suffer. A shared, integrated view of these risks, and a
strategy for their assumption and management, is critical to avoiding
rapid value destruction within the energy market," Smith said.


An Andersen survey of senior utility executives outside
California, also released at the briefing, indicates most utility
companies believe they inoculated themselves against the California
virus so that it is unlikely to affect their operations beyond slowing
the pace of deregulation and increasing investor scrutiny. However,
based on the potential implications it sees of the California
situation, Andersen believes a series of booster shots are advisable
for power companies and regulators. "To deliver reliable service at a
predictable cost in today's environment, companies must focus on
market integration by developing new and innovative relationships
between suppliers, customers, employees and investors -- while working
with government officials and regulators to chart a smoother
transition to a deregulated power market," according to Smith.


Eight Implications


The Andersen report identified eight overriding implications
emanating from the Western energy crisis that are shaping the
longer-term operations of the Western grid, the regional and national
economy, domestic energy policy and the industry's evolution:


1.  Increased deregulation uncertainty and risk -- Tension and


differences between state and federal regulators raise the


specter of repeating the regulatory and political conundrum


California's investor-owned utilities have faced. If federal


initiatives open wholesale markets while retail markets remain


regulated, a crucial question is raised: Will state regulators


pass-through higher wholesale costs if they should


materialize? Tensions between state and federal regulators


over policies on deregulation will grow if states delay or


abandon retail competition.


As wholesale markets are deregulated and RTOs begin operating,


the prudence principles that state regulators have used for


many years may have to be changed. For example, if FERC and


RTO monitors determine that deregulated wholesale markets


operate fairly, prices derived from those markets must be


considered reasonable. If so, these costs should be allowed


into state-regulated retail rates without regard to the


prudence principles state regulators have used for years.


Therefore, utilities' traditional burden of proving costs are


or are not justifiable shifts to regulators.


2.  Reduced investor confidence -- Prior to deregulation,


stringent prudence review and disallowance of generation costs


in the rate base made regulatory risk largely uncontrollable,


killing IOU interests in most new investment. A major purpose


of deregulation was to create an environment in which risk


could be managed, but California's political and regulatory


environment provides only a limited ability to manage risks.


The confidence and perceptions needed to support investment


decision-making will be slow to return given the approach of


the state to remedy the crisis.


3.  Contributing factor in economic softening -- Uncertain energy


reliability and higher costs can drive-out marginal


businesses, cause healthy companies to constrain expansion,


and lead new entrants to question whether to make new


investments. As such, an extended energy crisis contributes to


inflation pressures and may slow economic growth.


4.  Increased pressure on the Western grid -- Even as capacity


increases and demand reductions work to resolve the California


crisis, these solutions have long-term implications for the


Western Grid. These include a realistic possibility of


California becoming an "energy island" as a result of


near-term reduction in available regional resources for export


to California; increased emphasis on security control to


protect against overall Western grid failure as sub-regions


have problems; RTO requirements to strengthen locally


available supplies to bolster overall system reliability;


longer-term development of new plants using plentiful coal


resources and clean coal technology will alter the pattern of


imports into California; and the emergence of Mexico as a


major supplier to southern California and Arizona,


contributing to a bifurcation of the Western Grid into


northern and southern markets.


5.  Unbundling failures that push companies back to portfolio


strategies -- For California investor-owned utilities,


unbundling has achieved neither the least-cost solution sought


by regulators nor value maximization targeted by investors.


This necessitates a reevaluation of portfolio management


strategies potentially involving generation, transmission,


power trading and marketing, and retail businesses in multiple


geographies serving multiple markets.


6.  Ineffectiveness in changing siting and development


restrictions -- California's retail price caps and multiple


explanations for the crisis have left accelerated siting


processes and environmental standards changes open to


challenge by various interests. In addition, limiting


application of new siting orders only to small generators


contributes to uncertainty and investor hesitancy.


7.  Procurement management that alters user-utility negotiating


leverage -- Competitive markets compel participants --


suppliers, marketers, large industrial buyers, etc. -- to


strategically manage procurement as a critical value-driver.


Because risk is explicitly shared and always has the potential


of shifting advantage to either seller or buyer, the


sophistication of negotiations and contracts increases as


competitive markets evolve.


8.  Increased emphasis on distributed generation and new


technologies -- California's reliability and price challenges


have triggered a re-emergence of energy crisis measures from


the 1970s. End-users are investing in solutions they control,


and the distributed generation market is being aggressively


developed among large retailers, industrial users and


residential customers. This makes possible the development of


microgrids connecting consumers in local areas and related


changes in traditional grid systems, from modifications in


interconnection agreements to changing definitions of reserve


margins and system reliability.


Industry Executives' Response


Senior executives from sixteen non-California utilities with a
combined market capitalization over $120 billion and $145 billion in
revenues responded to an Andersen survey with their views of the
implications of the California power crisis for their companies and
for the industry. The survey, conducted between February 19, 2001 and
March 2, 2001 by Knowledge Systems &amp; Research, Inc. of Syracuse, found
that the companies are observing the California situation carefully,
expect a slowing -- but not a turnaround -- of deregulation, and
believe their internal plans and preparations are on-target for the
changing environment:


--  Deregulation -- Nearly all executives believe recent


California events will slow the pace of deregulation over the


next five years for states that have not begun or finished


writing restructuring legislation. None believe that it will


cause advanced states to re-regulate markets, although many


states will review their legislation to assess their risk of


duplicating California's current situation and make any


changes necessary to avoid it.


--  National legislation -- Few executives suggest the situation


will initiate national energy policy/legislation; others


believe it will be a continuing issue but, because of


state-to-state variances, Congress will be unable to pass any


comprehensive measures or force states to a restructuring


timeline. Some expect additional state-level legislation.


--  Company strategies -- Most do not see any changes to their


business models or strategies for generation, distribution or


supply procurement as a response to the situation in


California. However, many have expanded their risk management


programs, reduced spot market purchases, begun emphasizing


long-term supply contracts, planning new power generation


capacity, and started hedging with futures trades. Those


facing price caps are rethinking their stance on them.


--  Investor scrutiny -- Many executives indicate their


shareholders are aware of the situation and investors --


particularly institutional investors -- are more heavily


scrutinizing their actions. Many say news coverage has


prompted retail, commercial and industrial customer skepticism


of industry restructuring.


--  Transmission deregulation -- Many executives agree the


California situation will increase interest in FERC's regional


transmission organizations (RTO) deregulation effort.


Utility Company Action Items


Both to guard against a sudden California cascade and as a
potentially powerful competitive thrust, forward-thinking utilities
should bolster their basic preparedness with a variety of tactics --
or inoculations -- specifically aimed to combat a potential California
power virus, according to Andersen partner Mark Moskovitz:


--  Improve procurement management and risk management


capabilities -- To manage exposure to volatile supply and


demand shifts, organizations must be sure that comprehensive


and clear supply procedures, controls, decision points, risk


limits and communications are in place.


--  Plan and design innovative rate and pricing structures --


Companies and regulators must focus on communicating price


signals that create value for both the customer and the


provider. Innovative rate and pricing structures that more


closely tie the customer's price to the real cost of supply


will better signal the value of the service as well as


providing more accurate information upon which both end user


and supplier can make decisions.


--  Increase emphasis on demand side management (DSM) strategies


-- In addition to new pricing strategies to help achieve and


maintain supply-demand equilibrium, companies must now focus


on employing more extensive and innovative demand side


management programs. These programs may offer significant


benefits with limited risk to both the customer and energy


supplier.


--  Assess the supply and generation dynamics in adjacent


jurisdictions -- Companies must take a broader view -- beyond


typical geographic market definitions -- of the economics of


generation and related business decisions in an increasingly


volatile market in which supply will follow the best prices.


--  Develop contingency plans for the continued deferral of new


generation capacity -- In the face of potential ongoing


generation capacity shortages, companies and regulators must


be prepared to move with a portfolio of strategies to meet


demand, including for example DSM, flexible pricing and


distributed generation. In addition, they should explore


efficiency-improving upgrades to existing facilities and seize


any opportunity to accelerate near-term construction plans.


--  Proactively address potential organizational disruption -- As


regulatory and economic changes continue to churn the industry


waters and companies adjust and/or restructure, they must be


highly cogniscent of, sensitive to, and directly address


employees' concerns with information about the company's


future and theirs'.


Industry/Regulatory Lessons


There are also a number of broad primary lessons the electric
power industry -- nationally and internationally -- should take away
from its first major domestic test case in deregulation and
restructuring, according to Andersen principal David O. Jermain:


--  Simplify market design.


--  Build a continuing role for regulators.


--  Maintain communications with multiple constituent interests.


--  Prepare contingency plans for extreme stress conditions.


--  Couple real-time retail pricing with transparently priced


wholesale competition.


--  Provide special incentives for RTO investment, formation and


development.


--  Break down regulatory and political barriers to market signals


and responses.

Soaring Temperatures Produce Call for Conservation;=20
California ISO Also Announces New Outage Notification System and On-call=20
Number



FOLSOM, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 24, 2001 via NewsEdge Corporation  -
As the mercury
climbs this week, the California Independent System Operator
(California ISO) is reminding consumers to curb their electricity use
in order to minimize the strain on the power grid. The first warm
spell of the season is expected to cause temperatures to jump 10
degrees, leading to a 2,000 megawatt increase in electricity
consumption -- the equivalent of two large power plants. The week
started out with a peak demand of 28,835 megawatts, but by tomorrow it
is forecasted to top 30,500 megawatts. This comes as hydroelectricity
resources (both Northwest and California) run low, more than 10,000
megawatts of power plants remain off line due to planned and unplanned
maintenance, and some 3,000 megawatts of Qualifying Facilities or
alternative energy suppliers are not operating.


The California ISO's renewed call for conservation precedes a
forecast of 90 degree highs in the inland areas that may tempt many
Californians to flip on air conditioners. For conservation tips --
such as using fans instead of air conditioners, setting thermostat at
78 degrees, etc. -- please see the California ISO's web site
www.caiso.com.


New Notification System:


With a challenging summer around the corner, the California ISO
wants to do all it can to bring information to the public as quickly
as possible. For that reason, a new notification system is being
brought on line. Media and the public can now access the Internet to
keep current if rotating blackouts are issued.


Navigation:


Visit www.caiso.com


Click on System Conditions for current information on rotating


outages (will appear only when activated) For previous outage


information (last hour, etc.), click on Market Notices, scroll to


bottom of page and click on Notice Log


The California ISO is also testing a new service to notify
newsrooms immediately by email should the ISO initiate electrical
emergencies (Stage One - Three) or rotating outages. If you would like
to participate, please email kwerst@caiso.com with a maximum of one
email address per newsroom.


Additionally, a single on-call media pager number has been
established: 916/815-0679. To make it easier on media, ISO
Communications will no longer be posting on-call schedules for media
spokespersons on the web site. Simply call the on-call pager after
hours.


News releases alerting the media to electrical emergencies will
continue, as will news conferences held on-site in Folsom and via
telephone. As a reminder, if you wish to visit the ISO control rooms
(in Folsom or Alhambra) always call ISO Communications first at
888/516-NEWS to make an appointment. Access to the control rooms may
be limited on certain days, depending on system conditions and/or
level of requests from media.
