Subject: Regulatory issues memo: Revised

Enclosed is revised regulatory " issues" memo that  served as the basis for 
discussion at yesterday's regulatory  review  meeting--- the only outstanding 
issue , as I just communicated to Charles Still at Skadden, is confirmation 
of  the fact that there are no antitrust approvals required in South Korea 
relative to SK- that confirmation should be forthcoming from local counsel 
this evening.  Lisa- I assume you will see this gets to Bill Gathmann 
immediately so he can  forward on to regional general counsel for final 
sign-off.
