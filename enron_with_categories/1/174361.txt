Steve, 

As mentioned in my voice mail, attached is the email from SHRM about the 
proposed amendments to the Fair Labor Standards Act.  I believe that this 
legislation would be helpful to Enron.  Let me know if I can do anything to 
help.

Thanks.  Michelle

HHRMA members Lori Thomas and Lane Transou shared findings from the
Legislative Action Committee's FLSA-bonus survey (presented at September's
meeting) last Friday in Washington, D.C. with representatives of several
influential members of Congress. Pending legislation (sponsored in part by
Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison) would permit non-exempt employees to participate
in bonus programs without employers having to recalculate overtime rates.

Congress is ready to act. President Clinton may be willing to sign. We need
your help.

Please consider calling/e-mailing members of both houses, especially Phil
Gramm, Speaker Dennis Hastert (R-IL), and Houston area Congresspersons Ken
Bentsen, Bill Archer, Sheila Jackson Lee, Nick Lampson, Tom DeLay, Kevin
Brady, and Gene Green.

Contact information is at http://www.visi.com/juan/congress/. SHRM has sample 
E-Mail wording at http://cw2k.capweb.net/shrm/letterstate.cfm under "Bonus 
Legislation-House Version" and "Bonus Legislation-Senate Version." If 
possible, please copy President Clinton on your communications as well.
