This responds to Charles's voice mail and the RTO conference calls that Janel has been on where we have discussed responding to those who say the heightened interest in security is a reason NOT to do large RTOs.  Jim Steffes is the EPSA witness on reliability and other issues at a Barton subcommittee hearing next Wed., Oct. 10th.  While the written testimony filed for the Sept. 11 hearing that was canceled is still operative, Jim's oral remarks can be whatever he wishes.  Also, even if he does not raise it in his opening statement, the issue will no doubt come up by others or in Q&A.

Thus -- any talking points need to be ready by Tuesday for this hearing.  Does not have to be anything fancy or hand-out quality.  Just something for Jim to consider using.  Charles, I do not recall any specific articles on what NERC said, but Sarah Novosel said she would check since she thought there was something like what you raised in your voice mail.
