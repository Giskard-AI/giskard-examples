Michael,

I received today the attached letter from Jonathon Rosenthal of Saybrook
Capital.

Based on the conversation you and I had yesterday, I think that a proper
counter proposal would be to meet in LA, organize a credit committee,
and instruct Saybrook to seek funding from PG&E and SCE.  But, I would
be interested in hearing your thoughts.
