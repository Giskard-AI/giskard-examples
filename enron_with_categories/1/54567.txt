ABSTRACT:
 Fundamental properties of conditional value-at-risk, as a
 measure of risk with significant advantages over value-at-risk,
 are derived for loss distributions in finance that can involve
 discreetness. Such distributions are of particular importance in
 applications because of the prevalence of models based on
 scenarios and finite sampling. Conditional value-at-risk is able
 to quantify dangers beyond value-at-risk, and moreover it is
 coherent. It provides optimization shortcuts which, through
 linear programming techniques, make practical many large-scale
 calculations that could otherwise be out of reach. The numerical
 efficiency and stability of such calculations, shown in several
 case studies, are illustrated further with an example of index
 tracking.

 Keywords: Value-at-risk, conditional value-at-risk, mean
 shortfall, coherent risk measures, risk sampling, scenarios,
 hedging, index tracking, portfolio optimization, risk management
