I'm normally not a big fan of conferences, but this one may be of interest.  
I think it may be of even more interest if we don't speak: it's possible some 
utilities may say some of the same things we would say, but they may be less 
likely to do so if we speak and they feel they have to respond.  Let me know 
what you think.

The Energy Daily, the Edison Electric Institute, and the Electric Power 
Research Institute are co-sponsoring a summit on the vital issue of 
reliability in the energy industry.? This meeting will be held May 31, 2000 
in Washington, DC at the Edison Electric Institute's conference center. 

At this summit, we'll examine: 

* The need for new transmission lines and gas pipelines and how serious 
consumer opposition is to these factors. 

* Longer term generation requirements and how much is needed and the 
obstacles facing these requirements. 

* The role of TRANSCOs & ISOs in assuring reliability. 

* Plus, much more!
