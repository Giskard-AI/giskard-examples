Today's Washington Post contains a favorable comment on negawatts attributed 
to House Energy & Commerce Committee Chairman Tauzin, following efforts we 
made yesterday with the Chairman and his staff, both directly and via our 
consultants.  The Post article reads, "In the coming months, Tauzin said, 
Congress will take steps to allow consumers to sell power back to their local 
energy grids."  We, of course, will continue to push for a version of this 
concept that keeps this process open to multiple buyers and sellers, not just 
the local utility.  The article dovetails with information directly from 
Chairman Tauzin and Chairman Barton that they will continue to push our 
demand buydown proposal, although we are working with them to shore up 
support on the committee in the face of opposition from the usual suspects.
