Officials in California and Nevada, after months of lobbying for federal=20
regulators to cap Western power prices, warned yesterday that the newly=20
imposed limits have had the unintended consequence of increasing a threat o=
f=20
blackouts in the two states.=20
The warnings were issued as California came within minutes of rolling=20
blackouts yesterday afternoon, and one day after the first-ever rolling=20
blackouts in Las Vegas forced energy-hungry casinos to shut off fountains a=
nd=20
reduce air conditioning.=20
The two states are asking the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to take =
a=20
closer look at the so-called price mitigation plan and come up with revisio=
ns=20
that would deter power companies from withholding electricity during=20
shortages.=20
"We need some clarity to this order," said Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for t=
he=20
California Department of Water Resources, which is spending billions of=20
dollars to keep the state's lights on.=20
"Generators need to be held accountable," he said.=20
The crux of the problem is that price limits kick in during shortages, yet=
=20
power companies say these caps force them to sell power at below-market rat=
es=20
during periods of high demand.=20
Some companies have responded by holding back power rather than face the=20
expense of shipping electricity from state to state. Each mile that=20
electricity must be transmitted adds to the overall cost.=20
"No one's going to pay for transmission if the cost is near the caps," said=
=20
Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, an=20
energy-industry association in Menlo Park.=20
Ackerman said several companies in his organization decided that there was =
no=20
economic advantage to offering power in regional markets when price control=
s=20
are in effect.=20
"This means individual regions like California or Las Vegas could end up no=
t=20
having enough," Ackerman said. "It increases the threat of blackouts."=20
BLACKOUT ALERT CANCELED
California authorities issued a blackout alert at 1:45 p.m. yesterday when=
=20
power reserves dipped to dangerously low levels. They canceled the alert=20
about an hour later, after finding additional supplies.=20
"Everyone in the West is fighting for megawatts," said Stephanie McCorkle, =
a=20
spokeswoman for the California Independent System Operator, which oversees=
=20
the state's power network.=20
The Golden State's latest brush with lights-out conditions came a day after=
=20
Nevada experienced its own rolling blackouts for the first time, prompting=
=20
heavy power users such as the MGM Grand and Caesars Palace to dim their=20
lights.=20
Don Soderberg, chairman of the Nevada Public Utilities Commission, said tha=
t=20
the sudden power emergency took state authorities by surprise and that they=
=20
are investigating to see what role the federal price limits may have had in=
=20
exacerbating Monday's shortage.=20
"We're looking very closely at this," he said. "There seems to be a potenti=
al=20
for unintended consequences."=20
Specifically, Soderberg said Nevada is focusing on operators of older, less=
-=20
efficient plants who would find profit margins shrinking, if not vanishing,=
=20
under capped prices.=20
"We're going to see how the caps might have played into this," he said.=20
The federal ceiling in 10 Western states, excluding California, is about $9=
2=20
per megawatt hour. In California, a 10 percent surcharge is added because o=
f=20
the state's credit risk, bringing the price to just over $101.=20
Ackerman at the Western Power Trading Forum said regional price controls ha=
ve=20
extended California's power crisis to neighboring states.=20
"California sneezed and the rest of the region caught the virus," he said.=
=20
'LAWYERS LOOKING FOR LOOPHOLES'=20
California and Nevada officials, however, said that they still have faith=
=20
that price limits can stabilize Western electricity markets but that federa=
l=20
regulators may have to tweak the system so that power companies cannot=20
withhold output.=20
"The generators have banks of lawyers looking for loopholes (in the plan),"=
=20
said Hidalgo at the Department of Water Resources.=20
Unfortunately, it may take some time for the regulators to revisit an issue=
=20
that they took up only with the greatest reluctance. For months, federal=20
regulators refused to impose price controls, preferring instead to let supp=
ly=20
and demand determine costs.=20
Hidalgo said that when it appeared that power companies were throttling bac=
k=20
on output Monday, California officials immediately dialed the hot line numb=
er=20
provided by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in case of emergencies=
.=20
"No one answered," he said. "They were closed."=20
State officials tried again yesterday, and this time were told that the=20
commission would look into the matter. They were not given a time frame for=

when the commission might come up with a response.=20

Out-of-state generators pull plug over uncertainty on price controls
By Dale Kasler
Bee Staff Writer
(Published July 3, 2001)=20
Confused by the federal government's new controls on electricity prices,=20
generators withheld so much power from California on Monday that the state=
=20
was nearly plunged into rolling blackouts, state officials said.=20
The confusion began when the state's electric grid operators declared a Sta=
ge=20
1 power alert in the early afternoon, triggering the price caps for the fir=
st=20
time since they went into effect June 21.=20
Out-of-state generators pulled about 1,500 megawatts of electricity off the=
=20
table at midafternoon, enough to power about 1.1 million homes, because of=
=20
uncertainty about how much they could charge under the new Federal Energy=
=20
Regulatory Commission pricing system, said Oscar Hidalgo, spokesperson for=
=20
the state Department of Water Resources. The department buys electricity fo=
r=20
the state's financially distressed utilities.=20
"They didn't understand what they were going to be paid; there was confusio=
n=20
over the FERC order," Hidalgo said. "We saw 1,500 megawatts disappear."=20
The problem was exacerbated by a heat wave across the West, which forced=20
California to compete with other states for scarce electricity, he said.=20
Rolling blackouts hit southern Nevada.=20
Most California officials credit the FERC system, which is based on a=20
variable price cap, with reining in what had been a runaway wholesale power=
=20
market. But power generators have complained that the price caps, by limiti=
ng=20
profits, could discourage the production of critically needed electricity.=
=20
And as Monday's episode suggested, even the uncertainty about where the cap=
=20
will fall could lead to unexpected shortages.=20
"That's the risk that you run (with price controls)," said Arthur O'Donnell=
,=20
editor of the newsletter California Energy Markets. "People want any kind o=
f=20
certainty at all."=20
Hidalgo said the state avoided blackouts only because of last-minute import=
s=20
from the Bonne=0F'ville Power Administration, the federal agency that marke=
ts=20
government-produced hydroelectric power in the Pacific Northwest. The state=
=20
went into a Stage 2 power alert, the next-to-last level before blackouts ar=
e=20
ordered. The alert was canceled in late afternoon.=20
The blackouts would have been the first in California since May 8.=20
FERC imposed a round-the-clock ceiling on power throughout the West. The=20
price fluctuates and is tied to the production costs of the least-efficient=
=20
plant operating in California during a "power alert" declared by the=20
Independent System Operator, which runs the state's power-transmission grid=
.=20
When there's no alert, prices can't exceed 85 percent of the cap that was=
=20
established during the latest alert.=20
Until Monday, the maximum price held steady at about $101 a megawatt-hour i=
n=20
California. But when the ISO declared a Stage 1 power alert in early=20
afternoon, signifying that reserve supplies had dwindled to less than 7=20
percent of demand, confusion set in, Hidalgo and others said.=20
Because of a steep drop in the price of natural gas, which fuels many=20
California power plants, suppliers knew the cap would fall. But no one knew=
=20
by how much until the price was posted by the ISO.=20
The ceiling for California fell to about $77 at 3 p.m. but was back up to $=
98=20
in two hours, according to the ISO. Those prices include the 10 percent=20
premium that sellers can charge California because FERC said there's a cred=
it=20
risk in selling to the state.=20
O'Donnell said it's likely suppliers will pull back from the market every=
=20
time the ISO declares a power alert.=20
In-state generators have to operate their plants if summoned by the ISO. Bu=
t=20
out-of-state suppliers can withhold supplies, and on Monday it was the=20
out-of-staters that were pulling back, Hidalgo said.=20

Power Sales Halted by New Pricing Curbs=20

?????SACRAMENTO--Confusion over new federal price restrictions prompted=20
several electricity sellers to back away from sales to California on Monday=
=20
afternoon, pushing the state closer to blackouts, energy officials said.
?????The state lost sales that would have provided enough electricity to=20
supply more than 1 million homes, said Ray Hart, deputy director of the=20
California Department of Water Resources, which has been buying much of the=
=20
state's electricity since January.
?????At least five companies producing or marketing power "are telling us=
=20
that since they don't know what they're going to get paid, they're not goin=
g=20
to take the risk, and so they're not going to sell the energy," Hart said.
?????The electricity sales fell through after power consumption soared in=
=20
summer heat and grid operators were forced to declare a Stage 1 emergency,=
=20
meaning reserves had dipped below 7%. It was the first such emergency since=
=20
May 31.
?????Under a June 19 order by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission=20
intended to bring down wholesale electricity markets across the West, a pow=
er=20
emergency in California triggers the setting of a new price limit that=20
applies to power plant owners from Washington to Arizona.=20
?????The new price is supposed to be based upon whatever it costs to run th=
e=20
most inefficient, expensive power plant selling electricity to California=
=20
grid operators during the first full hour of a Stage 1 emergency.
?????But much uncertainty remains about exactly how and when the new price =
is=20
supposed to be established under the commission's order, and that apparentl=
y=20
drove away sellers, Hart said.
?????Shortly after the state issued the Stage 1 alert at 1:30 p.m., putting=
=20
the old price limit of $90 per megawatt-hour in question, companies that ha=
d=20
committed to provide the state electricity hour by hour Monday afternoon=20
backed out, Hart said. The companies include TransAlta Energy Marketing of=
=20
Oregon, Constellation Power of Baltimore and Sempra Energy Trading, a unit =
of=20
the San Diego-based energy conglomerate.
?????Forced to dip even deeper into the state's power reserves and declare =
a=20
Stage 2 emergency, water agency officials called the federal energy=20
commission's hotline for clarification about what the new price should be a=
nd=20
when it should take effect. They got no answer.
?????Hart said commission officials reached at home promised to try to=20
clarify their order today. One outstanding question is what obligations pow=
er=20
suppliers have to deliver electricity to California in an emergency.
?????Both buyers and sellers in the market agree that the new price, when i=
t=20
is set, will probably be lower than $90 per megawatt-hour because the price=
=20
of natural gas, the main fuel in California power plants, has dropped latel=
y.
?????Temperatures soared several degrees higher Monday than grid operators=
=20
had anticipated. But they said they expected to avoid rolling blackouts in=
=20
part because the Bonneville Power Administration in Portland, Ore., had=20
agreed to provide several hundred megawatts of Pacific Northwest hydropower=
=20
each hour in exchange for a return of electricity from California later thi=
s=20
summer.
