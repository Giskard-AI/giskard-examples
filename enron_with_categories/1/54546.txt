Natural Gas Futures Continue Lower=20

Natural gas futures on the NYMEX dropped lower yesterday as traders remaine=
d in a bearish mood following Wednesday's triple digit AGA report. The July=
 contract lost $0.074 to $4.038 per MMBtu, trading most of the session abov=
e the $4.00 support level as warm weather in the Northeast kept demand firm=
. August dipped $0.088 to $4.123 per MMBtu. Local and short-term traders' e=
arly efforts to push prices lower were successful, but some see the risk/re=
ward of additional selling at these levels limited. On Wednesday, the AGA r=
eported a storage inventory build of 105 Bcf from the previous week, well a=
bove both the 2000 injection of 78 Bcf and the 5-year average of 81 Bcf for=
 the comparable weeks. The selling sparked by the AGA number was encouraged=
 by some disappointment with weather conditions in the Northeast. Earlier t=
his week, some forecasters were calling for warmer temperatures, with some =
cities expected to be near 90 degrees. But temperatures in the region have =
been in the low to mid-80s. However, warmer weather is expected to continue=
 in the East though this weekend. Mild weather will linger in the north-cen=
tral and northwestern states. California and the western states will begin =
to heat up this weekend and early next week. Further tests of $4.00 are lik=
ely, with significant support at $3.80. Resistance is seen at $4.20. Natura=
l gas for next day delivery across the US and Canada was generally down $0.=
15  $0.25 yesterday, except out west, where the Topock delivery point tumbl=
ed over $1.00. Natural gas for next day delivery at the Henry hub dropped $=
0.16 to $3.97 per MMBtu.

Nova Scotia Wants Royalty Revenue

Nova Scotia wants a bigger share of the cash generated by its oil and natur=
al gas reserves to fund the regulators needed to monitor the growing indust=
ry, according to the provinces Premier. Speaking at an energy conference in=
 Halifax, he pleaded with the federal government to let the province keep m=
ore of the royalties. A 1986 offshore deal between Canada and Nova Scotia n=
ames the province as the main beneficiary of offshore oil and natural gas r=
oyalties, but the actual revenue split gives Ottawa 81% and Nova Scotia 19%=
. Nova Scotia already exports natural gas to New England from the Sable Off=
shore Energy Project. A possible second pipeline proposal to the Northeast =
US is being studied.=20

California Expects More Power Price Regulation

California lawmakers expect the FERC to strengthen its existing plan to lim=
it power prices during emergencies by expanding the plan to the entire West=
 for all hours of the day. The plan would fall short of the price caps. But=
, expanding the existing formula for price limits has picked up support amo=
ng Republicans who are under increasing pressure. FERC Chairman Hebert has =
called a special commission hearing for Monday to address the continuing is=
sues affecting California and the West. The proposal seeks to have FERC set=
 target prices for wholesale electricity prices on an around-the-clock basi=
s for the entire West. Under the existing plan, the FERC price limits are t=
riggered when the state declares a power emergency and are based on the amo=
unt that generators can charge to produce power at the least efficient plan=
t. Hebert says that since the FERC relief plan went into effect on May 29th=
, power prices in California have dropped to under $100 per MWh from earlie=
r in May over the $300 per MWh. The day-ahead market in California recently=
 traded about $45 per MWh.=20

Williams to Supply California Ethanol

Williams Bio-Energy has agreed to supply ethanol to California by the fourt=
h quarter of this year. Earlier this week, the EPA denied California's requ=
est to waive provisions of the 1990 Clean Air Act requiring the use of addi=
tives to make cleaner-burning gasoline. The decision means California will =
need about 580 million gallons of ethanol for RFG oxygenates in 2004, becau=
se the state banned MTBE by the end of 2002. Williams will house 15,000 bar=
rels of ethanol at Kinder Morgan Energy Partners storage facility in Carson=
, California, to supply the Los Angeles and San Diego markets. Williams pla=
ns transport ethanol to the storage facility and directly to refiners by la=
rge unit rail shipments and ocean vessels. =20

, 210 Bcfe, came from its most successful field, the Barnett Shale play in =
North Texas. The new reserves came from step-out drilling; drilling which o=
ccurs outside the previously confirmed area in the Barnett Shale, the fourt=
h-largest producing field in Texas. Mitchell currently holds 230,000 acres =
of the Barnett and has drilled the area for almost 50 years.=20

Natural Gas Investments in Mexico at Risk of Drying Up=20

Mexico has made changes to its natural gas price formulas, but they have pr=
oved insufficient to appease distributors, and Metrogas, Tractebel and Semp=
ra are threatening to halt investment in new projects. A more efficient and=
 more competitive regulatory standard is required. The Mexican regulatory c=
ommission for energy, the CRE has not changed the reference for prices whic=
h remains southern Texas. The federal commission for regulatory improvement=
s has a week to decide whether to accept the CRE's proposals. Mexico will r=
equire private sector investment of $114 Billion by 2009 in the sector. The=
 companies want to see a new standard established before the end of the yea=
r and all are thinking about pulling out if laws are not clear and in place=
. The CRE wants to adjust maximum prices only when the private companies ha=
ve completed five years of Mexican operations, something which will occur i=
n most cases next year. Pemex still controls rights on natural gas explorat=
ion.=20

House Appropriations Committee Rejects Power Price Caps

Republicans on the House Appropriations Committee have rejected a push by D=
emocrats to cap West Coast power prices, but Democrats said they will keep =
pressing the issue. The panel voted along party lines to defeat a bill to f=
orce FERC to cap wholesale electricity prices in the West. Democrats tried =
to stick the measure in a $6.5 billion spending bill that was intended main=
ly to fill out immediate defense needs this fiscal year. Rejecting the pric=
e caps amendment, Republicans argued it would not solve California's proble=
ms of tight supplies, but would further distort the marketplace. House Repu=
blican Whip DeLay of Texas said California's power crisis is the result of =
allowing environmental extremists to run the state government. Saying the f=
ederal government should not intervene in California's electricity market, =
Rep. Callahan of Alabama, who chairs the House Appropriations Energy and Wa=
ter subcommittee, said: I respectfully submit to you that you've made your =
own bed. Democrats countered that limiting prices to cover production costs=
 and a reasonable profit was essential to halt price gouging by unscrupulou=
s suppliers. Democrats hoped to persuade a few West Coast Republicans to su=
pport the price caps, but those on the committee resisted. Under the existi=
ng plan, the FERC price limits are triggered when the state declares a powe=
r emergency and are based on the amount that generators can charge to produ=
ce power at the least efficient plant. Generators can charge more if it can=
 be justified.=20

Dominion Plans WV Coal Fired Plant=20

Dominion and Anker Energy have plans to develop with a $600 Million, 450 MW=
, coal and coal waste fired facility and mining complex in Upshur County, W=
V. Dominion would be responsible for the construction, ownership and operat=
ion of the proposed facility, which will utilize state-of-the-art clean coa=
l technology and would burn more than 65% coal waste. Anker would provide a=
ll of the facility's fuel from on-site surface mining operations. This prop=
osed coal-fired plant is the first Dominion has developed since payingt $1.=
2 billion to the EPA last November for Clean Air Act violations pertaining =
to its coal-fired facilities. The proposed facility will be developed with =
NOx reducing equipment built-in. Also, the plant will utilize circulating f=
luidized bed boilers, technology that allows coal to be burned more efficie=
ntly. The CFB boilers can also burn low heat-content coal and waste fuel, s=
omething traditional burners cannot. All coal and coal waste produced will =
be burned on-site. Limestone will be used to react with sulfur in the coal =
to lower SO2 emissions.=20

APGA Believes Market Manipulated=20

Unsatisfied by the federal government's explanation that the high gas price=
s last winter were due mainly to supply and demand, the American Public Gas=
 Association says it believes the recent price drop is a signal that the ma=
rket may have been unfairly manipulated. In a letter sent to the EIA and to=
 key lawmakers, APGA insists that the supply/demand explanations do not tel=
l the full story. Rather, the association of municipal gas systems believes=
 price speculation played a major role in the dramatic upswing in prices du=
ring the 2000-2001 heating season. Citing FERC's investigation into gas pri=
ces at the California border, APGA said it is concerned not only about that=
 point, but also that market power gained through the unregulated control o=
f pipeline capacity will lead to unjust and unreasonable prices for natural=
 gas service throughout the US. APGA says it is convinced that the true cau=
se of record prices for gas will not be known unless the role played by ene=
rgy traders and price speculators is examined.=20
