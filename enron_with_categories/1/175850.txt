help is on the way.  We are going to establish some senior executive 
oversight as well as an executive director (probably someone who came through 
the program).  Charlene is going to be moving into a commercial role (which 
was the original plan when she was brought into the organization).  I'd be 
happy to talk to you in more detail when I get back to Houston.

Hi guys.  

I wanted to let you know that I am extremely concerned about the 
Associate/Analyst program, so much so that I feel all the work I have done, 
and all the time I have spent on the program has had little impact outside 
Wharton/Penn recruiting.  In fact we won't get more than 1 associate from 
Wharton this year for a variety of internal and external reasons.  This 
program has brought incredible talent into the organization, but we have lost 
a lot of momentum over the last two years.

In as much as I would like to continue to support the program, I can't  in 
its current form, and don't have time to fix what I thought we had been 
addressing.  The entire program is disfunctional, and the commercial teams 
are not lending support to the program.  I'd be very happy to spend a few 
minutes of your time (rather than blather on in an email) to give you both my 
overview of the program, and suggest changes and improvements.  

You know you have my support, but the current state of affairs down there has 
gotten me to my rope's end with the program.
