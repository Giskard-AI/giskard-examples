Here is the latest "CA" with everyone's changes.  I feel that this is pretty 
close to the best we can offer in terms of the stand-still and 
non-solicitation agreements.  Enron usually does not get into stand-still 
agreements, so doing this one was a big step for Enron.  Look forward to 
talking to you tomorrow morning.  Thanks for your patience.  Again, this is a 
draft copy for discussions purposes only.
Regards,
Ben
