Bill, we hit a home run this morning with HCAD.  They have agreed to take my 
reduced valuation on the Enron fleet.  A reduction of  $16,079,000 in taxable 
value.  This results in savings of $482,375.  That's not all, our allocation 
based on records for operations outside of the state of Texas resulted in 
additional savings of $1,559,638. Total savings to our 2000 budget will be 
$2,042,013.
