Mary- Ken has been asked by Mayor Brown to chair the fundraising effort to 
get voter approval on a light rail referendum in Houston.  My guess is that 
he will decline given the other demands on his schedule, but I don't know 
that for sure.  I think our respnse

Office of the Chairman:

While traveling within Germany recently, I noticed that electric powered 
trains are popular and also provide a safe, reliable, affordable and 
comfortable means of transportation to the public.

This brought to mind a question to ask you:

Is Enron taking any action to promote development and implementation of 
electric trains or light rail in the USA and/or abroad, either through the 
Political Action Committee, Lobbying or through the efforts of the Business 
Development Offices?

I do believe that the commuters would benefit from having access to electric 
trains that provide safe, clean and comfortable transport. Enron could 
potentially benefit by supplying the power for these trains within the USA 
(and abroad as well). 

Just think if the city of Houston offered light rail as an option for 
commuting to and from work, as well as commuting to other locations - both 
interstate and intrastate. A person could take a train to Galveston, Austin, 
or elsewhere and arrive in short time with the high speed rail available. 
With the new Ballpark downtown and the revitalization of the downtown area, 
it would seem that a legitimate method of public transportation is the 
element that is missing from the Houston city model. Buses that run on diesel 
are clearly not the solution for mass transit.
