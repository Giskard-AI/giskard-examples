I know we are holding for a later filing, but I have attached further comments anyway.  The document is still too rough to send out.  We need to take the opportunity, as soon as possible, to get a hard hitting, thoroughly researched and carefully written document in front of the Commissioners.  California's reaction to the Judge's recommendation is likely to give FERC (especially the new commissioners) a feel for how irrational the California politicians can be.  We will have a limited opportunity to take advantage of that realization.  We need to hit it hard in the pleading, our conversations at the Commission, the Hill and the media.
