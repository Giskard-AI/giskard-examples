Subject: Budget transition info

Hi, Steve - 

Dennis Vegas has requested budget information from Kelly on the people from 
EBS that are transferring over to Corp.  Kelly is on vacation now, for the 
next week and a half, and I wanted to check with you to make sure that it is 
OK to share these documents with him.  They are what Kelly reviewed with you 
in your initial meeting regarding the subject.  He only asked for information 
on the people shifting to Corp, not the people on redeployment, so I could 
delete that portion of these documents.  Perhaps I could only send him the 
first document that is about budget, but with the redeployment information 
taken out.

Sorry to bother you, but I am concerned about doing the right thing and 
following protocol in Kelly's absence.

Thanks, Stacy
