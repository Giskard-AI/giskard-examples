Hoyt,

If GSP LLC  would assume the liability at the time of return, why would it 
risk bringing them back for light duty work?  Why not wait until they are 
fully released, particularly if one of them is going to sue under workers 
comp scheme?

Also, Hoyt, you need to be careful about revealing conversations with GSP 
counsel to MG -- I noticed you had cc'd someone from Media General in the 
prior email.  We don't want to waive any privileges.

Michelle

     Peter, we have two long-term worker's comp cases whose accidents
     happened before Enron bought GSP.  We would like to bring them back to
     do light-duty work, to get them in the swing of working again and also
     to get some adminstrative work done.

     I am concerned that bringing these employees back to work on light
     duty will cause these cases to become an Enron liability rather than
     an MG liability. I discussed this with Pat McCarthy, the labor and
     employment law attorney we are using in NJ, and he said that the
     liability would typically not transfer to GSP just because we brought
     them back . . . it would still be an MG liability, UNLESS THE EMPLOYEE
     HURT HIMSELF AGAIN.  In which case, GSP owns it.

     However, Pat said that a lot of what determines the ownership of the
     worker's comp cases is written into the purchase and sale agreement.
     He said that there may be language that addresses an employee's return
     to work from worker's comp.  I know that we have an ongoing dispute
     about worker's comp with MG at this point.  What would be your
     recommendation on bringing these employees back to work?

     As a bit of additional info, one of the two employees seems eager to
     come back . . . the other one does not.  An employee told me that the
     second employee actually has a lawsuit filed against MG/old GSP about
     his injury.
