Steve and Rick,

EES is considering "re-sourcing" the new customers in SDG&E's area -- because 
of the uncertainty over whether the CA Procurement Charge will apply to those 
customers.  I think this proposed action needs to be evaluated from a 
nationwide perspective -- this has long-term negative implications for 
Enron's credibility in the DA market as a whole.
