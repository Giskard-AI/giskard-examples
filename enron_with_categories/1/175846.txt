Mark and Steve, sorry to bother you with this, but I'm at a loss.  This guy 
(Jim Cofield) called me on my cell phone last night about 7:00 p.m. to get my 
e-mail address.  He asked that I take a look at his e-mail in the morning and 
route it to the appropriate person within Enron.  

The ".jpg" files below have no information in them, but the ".doc" file is a 
14 page document with numerous correspondence from Mary Beth Cahill, former 
director in the White House Office for Public Liaison, to Mr. Cofield 
regarding a trip to Nigeria that he supposedly accompanied President Clinton 
on several months ago; followed by a number of "proprietary information 
documents" that mean absolutely nothing to me; followed by an overview of 
Nigeria's electrical power situation; etc....The best I can tell, they are 
trying to get Enron to bid on some project in Nigeria.

Since this e-mail is copied to the Vice President of the United States in 
addition to several ambassadors, I thought it might need attention.  If you 
can figure it out, please let me know how to proceed.  Thanks, SRS
