Observations on the California Electricity Crisis
White House Writers Group
January 23, 2001

Will the last business to leave California please turn out the lights.
Oh wait, they?re already out.

California Governor Gray Davis may ultimately prove responsible for the=20
dimming of more lights than Frank Sinatra music.

California has done for energy deregulation what Florida has done for=20
elections.

California Governor Gray Davis says he?ll appoint a "power plant czar" to=
=20
help solve the state?s energy crisis.  There must be a sign on his desk=20
saying, "The buck stops here=06?just long enough for me to pass it to someo=
ne=20
else."

During the current energy crisis in California, the spotlight shines on=20
Governor Gray Davis=06?so long as it?s not knocked out by rolling blackouts=
,=20
that is.

Gray Davis was shocked when told about the "doomsday scenario."  Not the on=
e=20
from Pacific Gas & Electric which envisions California power blackouts=20
lasting 12 hours a day, the one from his aides saying he might lose the=20
governor?s race in 2002.

California politicians have learned what thieves have known for a longtime.=
 =20
It?s easier to pick someone?s pocket in the dark.

California is talking conservation.  One good conservation measure would be=
=20
for Governor Gray Davis to save his breath trying to convince people that=
=20
government control is the answer to the energy crisis.


Possible Jingle Themes for Gray Davis Re-election Bid:

My Hopes Were High 'til the Lights Went Low

Brother, Can You Spare a Megawatt?

There's Dark at the End of the Tunnel

Return Me to Power (Even if You Don't Have Any)


Top 10 Reasons to Not Have California Government Electricity

10:  Would create yet another oxymoron.

9:  Electricity might go to wrong address the way mail does.

8:  Promise of efficient electricity gives politicians one more thing to li=
e=20
about.

7:  Power keeps going off when Rush Limbaugh comes on air.

6:  Light bulbs would match politicians for dimness.

5:  Special tax on flashlights.

4:  Fifteen day waiting period to use microwave.

3:  Rolling blackouts joined by rolling the taxpayers.

2:  Consumer manual on government-mandated way to change a light bulb runs=
=20
25,000 pages.

1:  Nine words: From the same people who gave you the DMV.

Observations on the California Energy Crisis
The White House Writers Group
January 31st



Gray Davis has announced that he will soon announce two energy czars to lea=
d=20
the state through the current crisis.  Logical candidates include: Laurel a=
nd=20
Hardy, Abbott and Costello, Beavis and Butthead, and Siegfried and Roy.

The environmentalist Green Party is well-named.  Thanks to its role in=20
blocking construction of new power plants, Californians are forking over=20
plenty of green for energy.

California?s power industry is very Kennedyesque.  Their message to consume=
rs=20
is, "Ask not what your energy company can do for you; ask what you can do f=
or=20
your energy company."

Congress might get involved in California?s energy crisis.  There?s nothing=
 a=20
drowning victim needs more than having an anchor thrown to him.

It?s one thing for California politicians trying to solve the energy proble=
m=20
to go back to the drawing board, but do they have to ask taxpayers to buy=
=20
them a new one?

In California, lawmakers are now getting down to details.  The latest debat=
e=20
involves what to name the bonds the state will issue to help bail out the=
=20
utilities.  Proposals on the table include:  Blackout Bonds;Bailout Bonds;=
=20
Davis Debts; Blunder Bonds; Fiasco Funds.
