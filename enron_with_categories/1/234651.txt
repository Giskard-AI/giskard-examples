The prehearing conference in the CA case was an interesting proceeding.  It=
 became very apparent that the ISO was primarily responsible for the delay =
in producing data.  The parties complained that they had not received what =
the ISO had promised.  The PX complained that they had received NO reliable=
 data from ISO (it was riddled with errors) and that they were at the same =
point as at the beginning of the entire proceeding.  The PX needs the ISO d=
ata in order to commence generating the data that the PX itself needs to pr=
oduce.  In any event, the new, delayed schedule is a positive development. =
 It is noteworthy that we were able to group consideration of refunds issue=
s and offsets to refunds on the same date- October 26 (previously refund te=
stimony was considered first, and testimony related to possible offsets to =
refunds was considered on a subsequent date).  This is very positive since =
it reduces the chance that the proceeding will be only about refunds and th=
at the offsets issue will be marginalized.  Ray Alvarez

The DC Team (Linda Robertson, Ray Alvarez) attended and reported on today's=
 prehearing conference in the California case.  The schedule has moved back=
 about a full month mostly due to the time required by PX and CAISO to prod=
uce mitigated market clearing prices and to re-run settlements based on tho=
se revised prices.  Testimony by Enron on what it is owed is now not due un=
til October 26.  In addition to adopting this schedule, the ALJ reported th=
at the FERC likely not rule on petitions for rehearing of the July 25 order=
 until October 15, 2001.

A revised schedule is attached.  (To see how it has changed, you can toggle=
 Track Changes | Hightlight on Screen on and off)

The PNW case is moving along on schedule; changes attached are corrections =
rather than actual changes to the schedule.  Notably in today's case, Seatt=
le and Tacoma waived all cross on TFG witnesses, including Enron's.
