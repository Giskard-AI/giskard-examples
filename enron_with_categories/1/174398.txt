The senator's speech is focused on the oil sector almost exclusively, but it 
does an exceptional job of framing the importance of the issue.

Rosalee: I understand that Ken Lay and Senator Hagel will be together this 
evening at the Horatio Alger event I believe in Williamsburg. The attachment 
is the speech Chuck gave this week before ESI and Ken may find it helpful in 
some discussion tonight. Joe

     I thought you might be interested in seeing a copy of a speech on
     international energy policy that Sen. Hagel gave today at the Economic
     Strategy Institute in Washington, D.C.
