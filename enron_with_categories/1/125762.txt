Expect prices to shoot up, analysts say
By Dale Kasler
Bee Staff Writer
(Published May 4, 2001)=20
Gov. Gray Davis' plan for solving the energy crisis relies partly on a=20
striking assumption: that the state's power expenditures will drop=20
dramatically this summer.=20
But energy-market analysts believe Davis is underestimating the cost of=20
electricity and say the state should brace for a significant run-up in pric=
es=20
during what is likely to be a summer of chronic shortages.=20
In particular, analysts question Davis' prediction the state will pay an=20
average of $195 a megawatt-hour on the spot market from July to September, =
a=20
44 percent reduction from the projected average price for April through Jun=
e.=20
"One hundred and ninety-five dollars? Boy, I wish it were true," said Sever=
in=20
Borenstein of the University of California Energy Institute. "My estimate i=
s=20
substantially higher."=20
Yet Davis' advisers are sticking by their projection of the state's power=
=20
costs, released Monday to a skeptical Legislature by private consultants to=
=20
the governor. They say the lower cost estimates reflect expected increases =
in=20
supplies, the projected impact of California's new conservation program and=
=20
the state's growing ability to wean itself from the ultra-expensive spot=20
market and buy much of its power through cheaper long-term contracts.=20
Prices may rise, but spending by the state will decline, starting this=20
summer, they insist.=20
"This is a very credible plan," said Joseph Fichera, a Wall Street financie=
r=20
advising the governor. "We have done things to mitigate our exposure (to th=
e=20
spot market)."=20
The credibility of the projections is crucial to the state's plan to sell $=
10=20
billion worth of bonds -- a key element of Davis' rescue plan. The bonds=20
would compensate the state for past and future power purchases made on beha=
lf=20
of moribund Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Co., wi=
th=20
ratepayers ultimately footing the bill. Davis expects the state to spend=20
$18.7 billion on power by June 2002.=20
But if electricity costs go higher than Davis expects, the strain on the=20
state's budget could worsen, complicating the bond sale. Republican=20
lawmakers, wary of higher costs and distrustful of Davis' projections, have=
=20
been threatening to block the sale.=20
Higher-than-expected costs also would increase the likelihood of blackouts;=
=20
Davis acknowledged last week that the state might stop purchasing electrici=
ty=20
at times when prices go out of sight.=20
And many private-sector experts believe prices will surely rise.=20
"I see no reason, given what's happened the past six months, that the next=
=20
six months is going to be dramatically different," said Keith Bailey, chief=
=20
executive of generator Williams Cos., which sells power to California.=20
One great unknown is the impact of a "price mitigation" plan approved last=
=20
week by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Price caps would kick in=
=20
when California's power reserves are less than 7 percent of demand -- the=
=20
so-called "power alert" days.=20
Bailey said the plan would have "a very real effect," but state officials=
=20
called it inadequate. "More holes than Swiss cheese," Davis said this week.=
=20
In Washington, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and other Western senators=
=20
tore into FERC Chairman Curtis Hebert Jr. at a hearing on the price=20
mitigation plan. Feinstein wondered aloud why the FERC didn't simply=20
establish a firm ceiling on prices.=20
As it stands now, California officials have been spending upward of $50=20
million a day for Edison and PG&E; the tab can fluctuate wildly from day to=
=20
day as prices shoot up and down. On Thursday, prices in California ranged=
=20
between $214 and $240 a megawatt-hour, depending on location, for peak-time=
=20
power, according to industry newsletter Enerfax Daily.=20
Because summertime demand is typically about 50 percent higher than it is i=
n=20
spring, most analysts expect prices to rise. California electricity futures=
=20
prices, considered by many to be a decent gauge of where prices are going,=
=20
are trading at $375 a megawatt-hour for July and $525 for August, Enerfax=
=20
said.=20
"I would trust the traders," said Gary Ackerman of the Western Power Tradin=
g=20
Forum, an association of power generators. "They've been right more often=
=20
than the Davis administration."=20
The Northwest drought, robbing California of cheap hydropower, is a key=20
reason many analysts believe costs won't drop.=20
"What it all adds up to is much less imported hydroelectric power than we'r=
e=20
used to," said Arthur O'Donnell, editor of the California Energy Markets=20
newsletter.=20
But Davis' consultants say new power is coming from other sources this=20
summer, easing prices. New power plants, scheduled to begin operations this=
=20
summer, will add 4,500 megawatts of power to California's energy-starved=20
grid, Davis said.=20
O'Donnell, though, said the new plants won't provide immediate relief. "Pow=
er=20
plants, in their start-up phase, frequently have problems," he said.=20
Another unknown quantity is the fate of hundreds of cogenerators, wind farm=
s=20
and other alternative-energy providers that deliver more than 20 percent of=
=20
the state's electricity under contract to the utilities.=20
After going months without payment from PG&E and Edison, scores of these=20
producers shut down in February and March, depriving the state of an=20
estimated 3,000 megawatts of power and contributing mightily to two days of=
=20
blackouts in March.=20
About 800 megawatts of power returned to service in April, after PG&E and=
=20
Edison were ordered to resume paying the generators, the two utilities said=
.=20
And Fichera said more will come back starting June 1, when their contracts=
=20
say they must operate or face financial penalties.=20
But some generators say they won't produce full throttle this summer. Anger=
ed=20
at a new payment schedule that substantially cuts their income, they'll run=
=20
"the absolute bare minimum" to fulfill their contracts, said Hal Dittmer of=
=20
Wellhead Electric Co., a small generator that's been shut down.=20
Representatives of the small generators met with Davis on Thursday, with=20
Davis agreeing to work with them on the possibility of increasing their=20
payments, said generators' attorney Jerry Bloom.=20
Davis, meanwhile, also is betting that energy usage will fall. Recently=20
approved rate hikes will create "sticker shock" that will cut demand 3=20
percent, Fichera said. The state's conservation program will contribute an=
=20
additional 4 percent, he said.=20
"If we buy less than what (generators) expect, prices drop," Davis said.=20
Above all, the state has completed or is in final negotiations on a slew of=
=20
long-term contracts with major generators -- deals that will substantially=
=20
cut the state's dependence on the spot market and reduce its overall power=
=20
bill, said Ron Nichols of Navigant Consulting Inc., which developed the=20
power-cost estimates for Davis.=20

GOP: Shrink plan for bonds
By John Hill
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published May 4, 2001)=20
The state should bite the bullet and use $5 billion of its surplus to pay f=
or=20
electricity instead of borrowing the money and prolonging the fiscal agony,=
=20
Assembly Republicans said Thursday.=20
Paying up front is preferable to a Democratic plan that would "saddle=20
electric customers with higher utility rates to pay the state back with=20
interest," said Assemblyman Bill Leonard of San Bernardino, one of 30 membe=
rs=20
of the Assembly Republican Caucus.=20
But the caucus's plan drew fire from state Treasurer Phil Angelides, a=20
Democrat in charge of putting together the bond deal. He said a GOP block o=
f=20
the bond deal would cut into this year's spending for education and=20
transportation and "take the state toward fiscal insolvency."=20
Angelides said the Republican stance will force the Legislature to pass the=
=20
bill authorizing bonds with a simple majority, needing no GOP votes but=20
requiring a 90-day wait for the bill to become law. By that time, he said,=
=20
the state will be perilously close to running out of money.=20
"It is to me, from a business perspective, one of the most irresponsible ac=
ts=20
I've witnessed," he said.=20
The Assembly Republican plan calls for the state to sell $8 billion in bond=
s,=20
instead of the $12.5 billion proposed by Gov. Gray Davis. This move would=
=20
relieve pressure for more electricity rate increases, Leonard said.=20
The Republicans would make up the difference by taking $5 billion from the=
=20
state's general fund. That's money the Democratic governor proposed in=20
January would go to one-time expenditures on a variety of projects, from=20
clean beaches to housing, as well as new spending on schools.=20
The Republican plan calls for rate rebates for people whose electric=20
utilities are publicly owned, such as the Sacramento Municipal Utility=20
District. Some argue that these ratepayers are getting a bad deal because=
=20
their tax money is subsidizing ratepayers whose utilities are in financial=
=20
trouble.=20
It also includes past Republican proposals that have stagnated in the=20
Legislature, such as allowing residential customers to make deals with=20
independent electricity providers and encouraging quick building of power=
=20
plants.=20
Although the Republicans are in the minority, they wield leverage in the=20
energy debate because a bill that would authorize a bond sale requires a=20
two-thirds vote. At least five of the 30 Assembly Republicans would have to=
=20
vote for it.=20
The Republicans say they are uncomfortable with the size of the bond deal=
=20
proposed by Davis, which combined with other energy bond sales could top $2=
0=20
billion. "It's too much to swallow," said James Fisfis, a spokesman for the=
=20
caucus.=20
Fisfis said the plan represents a preliminary response to Democratic=20
proposals -- a "starting point in negotiations and a vision of Republicans=
=20
and what they would do if they were governing."=20
"We don't want those phony messages that everything's fine and hunky-dory,=
=20
and it's not," he said. "This is a time for financial restraint."=20
The Republican proposal blasts as "expensive gimmickry" a plan by Angelides=
=20
to get a $4.1 billion bridge loan from three major lenders to keep the stat=
e=20
flush until the bonds are sold.=20
Angelides said such loans are routine when California and other states sell=
=20
bonds. The loan in this case, he said, provides "momentum" for what's likel=
y=20
to be the biggest bond sale in U.S. history. "It's three of the most powerf=
ul=20
investment banks in the country side by side with us, signalling to the wor=
ld=20
marketplace that they believe in this transaction," he said.=20
The fees to the investment banks of several million dollars represent a=20
fraction of one day of the state's power costs, he said.=20
Legislative Analyst Elizabeth Hill said the proposal would require all $2.3=
=20
billion in one-time expenditures in the governor's budget to be axed, as we=
ll=20
as $2.7 billion of proposed year-to-year spending.=20
In addition, state revenues for the fiscal year starting July 1 appear to b=
e=20
lower than anticipated, so the Republican plan might force even more cuts,=
=20
she said.=20
The Republican caucus plan came the same day that Secretary of State Bill=
=20
Jones, the lone Republican statewide officeholder and a GOP candidate for=
=20
governor next year, released his own ideas on the energy crisis.=20
Jones, in a letter to Vice President Dick Cheney, said the state "is on the=
=20
brink of fiscal insolvency" because of Davis' efforts to buy power.=20
Instead of selling bonds or negotiating to buy the utility companies'=20
transmission lines or other assets, the state should ask power generators t=
o=20
forgive some of the nearly $14 billion they're owed in exchange for immedia=
te=20
payment, Jones said.=20
In addition, the state should offer low-interest loans to utilities to help=
=20
them repay their debt, using the power lines as collateral. Finally, he sai=
d,=20
the utilities' parent companies should help reduce the debt.=20
While Jones said the Davis plan is "socializing the delivery of power," the=
=20
state Senate on Thursday sent the governor a bill that will likely drive th=
e=20
state further into the energy business by allowing a public power authority=
=20
to run its own power plants.=20
The authorizing bill, SB 6x by state Senate President Pro Tem John Burton,=
=20
D-San Francisco, passed the Senate on a 24-14 party-line vote.=20
The agency would have access to $5 billion in bond money with which it coul=
d=20
build, run and seize power facilities and institute conservation programs.=

FERC chief defends plan for state=20
By David Whitney and David Westphal
Bee Washington Bureau
(Published May 4, 2001)=20
WASHINGTON -- The chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission=20
sternly defended the panel's new plan for controlling California electricit=
y=20
prices Thursday amid mounting criticism that it is too little and too late =
to=20
do much good.=20
The criticism came from Democrats and one Republican, Oregon Sen. Gordon=20
Smith, at a hastily arranged hearing of the Senate Energy and Natural=20
Resources Committee that was intended to be a forum for FERC Chairman Curt=
=20
Hebert Jr. to dispel concerns that the plan won't protect consumers from=20
price-gouging electricity marketers.=20
The order, approved last week by a 2-1 vote, is supposed to dampen prices=
=20
without rigid price controls by ordering generators to sell all the power=
=20
they produce and setting a benchmark price based on the highest-cost,=20
least-efficient plant operating during periods of emergency shortages.=20
"FERC is acting," Hebert said. "FERC is acting responsibly. ... We're doing=
=20
what we can do."=20
But the commission's lone dissenter on last week's order, William Massey,=
=20
charged that the measures to control skyrocketing prices would be in effect=
=20
only during power emergencies when supplies were tightest. And while that=
=20
might be as much as 40 percent or 45 percent of the time during the long ho=
t=20
summer, he said, that still leaves most of the time when power marketers ar=
e=20
free to sell at whatever price they can get.=20
"I have no confidence that prices will be fair and just at all times this=
=20
summer," Massey said.=20
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., continued on that theme. She produced what=
=20
was described as a "megawatt laundering" blueprint she had received detaili=
ng=20
how FERC's order could be used to trade power back and forth between=20
marketers to bid up wholesale prices in a way that would be outside FERC=20
monitoring.=20
The contentious hearing came as the FERC is about to publish notice in the=
=20
Federal Register to expand the price monitoring plan to Oregon, Washington=
=20
and other Western states.=20
But Smith said he thought the commission was misreading the political=20
firestorm brewing throughout the West if it thought its plan would quell=20
outrage over rising prices.=20
"Are you aware of the head of steam that is building up?" asked Smith, who=
=20
said prices in his region are 10 or 12 times what they were a year ago. "Th=
is=20
is unsustainable, for this administration, for this Congress."=20
Smith and Feinstein have introduced legislation that would temporarily cap=
=20
wholesale power rates at the cost of production plus a fixed profit margin.=
=20
Feinstein, who was more supportive of the FERC order after its release last=
=20
week, said after the hearing that she now believes it is flawed by too many=
=20
loopholes and problems.=20
"I can't understand why they are doing this," she said.=20
Meanwhile, one of California's biggest power customers, the U.S. military,=
=20
vowed Thursday to reduce its peak-hours electricity use by 10 percent this=
=20
summer as President Bush expressed new concern about the state's looming=20
season of blackouts.=20
"We're worried about blackouts that may occur this summer and we want to be=
=20
part of any solutions," said Bush, who gave federal officials 30 days to=20
implement electricity-reducing plans.=20
Gov. Gray Davis welcomed the president's comments, but said the plan falls=
=20
short. "Surely the federal government can do more and match California's 20=
=20
percent savings at all state buildings," he said.=20
Vice President Dick Cheney, in a speech earlier this week, spoke dismissive=
ly=20
of conservation efforts in the 1970s, and warned that the nation won't be=
=20
able to "simply conserve or ration our way out of the situation we're in."=
=20
But Bush spoke repeatedly Thursday of the importance of conserving. "We've=
=20
got to do both," he said. "We must conserve, but we've also got to find new=
=20
sources of energy."=20
The administration set no target for reducing federal power use, but=20
recommended actions such as turning off escalators and raising thermostats =
to=20
78 degrees when state reserves fall below 5 percent.=20
"We're not trying to pick a figure arbitrarily out of the sky," said Energy=
=20
Secretary Spencer Abraham.=20
Earlier, in a letter to Congress, Davis excoriated federal inaction on=20
soaring electricity rates as he prepared to meet in Sacramento with Abraham=
=20
on Thursday evening.=20
"With all our actions in California, it is a travesty that on the one issue=
=20
over which the federal government has exclusive jurisdiction -- wholesale=
=20
energy prices -- it has utterly failed to discharge its responsibility,"=20

PG&E to judge: ISO, $1 billion tab will drain us
By Claire Cooper
Bee Legal Affairs Writer
(Published May 4, 2001)=20
SAN FRANCISCO -- Pacific Gas and Electric Co. asked a federal bankruptcy=20
judge Thursday to bar the operator of California's power grid from buying=
=20
electricity for the utility or collecting almost $1 billion now due for pas=
t=20
wholesale purchases.=20
PG&E's bankruptcy estate would be depleted by paying the high prices passed=
=20
on by the California Independent System Operator, the utility said in askin=
g=20
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali to issue an injunction.=20
PG&E filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization April 6. The utility's=
=20
corporate parent, San Francisco-based PG&E Corp., is not part of the=20
bankruptcy proceedings.=20
The ISO buys electricity from independent wholesalers to supplement whateve=
r=20
power the utilities can send to the grid, matching supply with demand on a=
=20
daily basis. Throughout the past year it has provided as much as 30 percent=
=20
of the state's electricity and as little as 10 percent on any given day, sa=
id=20
ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson.=20
ISO Vice President Elena Schmid said Thursday that the ISO stopped buying=
=20
electricity for PG&E after being told to do so April 6 by the Federal Energ=
y=20
Regulatory Commission because the utility no longer was creditworthy.=20
But the PG&E legal complaint said the ISO continued making purchases throug=
h=20
April 30 at an average cost almost six times as high as the frozen retail=
=20
rates that PG&E can charge its customers.=20
Even with an upcoming rate increase, said the complaint, PG&E could lose $2=
28=20
million a month if it depended on the ISO for 25 percent of its electricity=
.=20
Since mid-January, the California Department of Water Resources also has be=

buying electricity for PG&E and Southern California Edison, under AB 1x,=20
legislation that authorized state power purchases and rate increases if=20
necessary to repay the state.=20
PG&E said in the complaint that the state water department has limited its=

Here's what I found about Con Ed. The company sold most of its power plants=

and, like California utilities, failed to lock in multiyear contracts with=

Legislature sends power authority bill to governor=20

ASSOCIATED PRESS=20
May 3, 2001=20
SACRAMENTO =01) California is poised to enter the power business after the =
state=20
Senate approved the creation of a public power authority and sent its bill =
to=20
Gov. Gray Davis Thursday.=20
A power authority, supporters said, will give the state more control over i=
ts=20
wholesale electricity market by building and operating its own power plants=
.=20
State-owned plants could charge lower prices, and building new plants could=
=20
increase supply and ease wholesale prices.=20
If signed by the Davis, the bill creates a California Consumer Power and=20
Conservation Financing Authority that could issue up to $5 billion in reven=
ue=20
bonds to pay for power plants, natural gas storage and additional pipelines=
=20
and conservation programs.=20
Davis has said he supports creating a public power authority similar to one=
=20
in New York. The New York authority has 10 power plants, 1,400 miles of=20
transmission lines and produces about 25 percent of the state's power.=20
Nebraska also has a power authority, which created a market in which=20
residents pay 22 percent less than the national average, said Sen. John=20
Burton, D-San Francisco, who wrote the bill.=20
A Davis spokesman said Thursday that although the governor has supported th=
e=20
concept of a power authority, he has not decided whether or not to sign the=
=20
legislation.=20
The authority would be run by the state treasurer and four other members=20
appointed by the governor.=20
Opponents of the plan, most of them Republicans, have said an authority=20
thrusts the state into a power market in which it doesn't belong and could=
=20
obstruct private interests' efforts to build and operate power plants.=20
The new board would also be able to seize plants by eminent domain, a power=
=20
the governor also has under an emergency order issued in January.=20
Sen. Steve Peace, D-El Cajon, said California needs the authority because t=
he=20
1996 deregulation law didn't create real competition and the Federal Energy=
=20
Regulatory Commission refuses to control rising wholesale prices.=20
The state's deregulation is "the economic equivalent to the World Wrestling=
=20
Federation," Peace said. "The wrestlers follow a script and the referee,=20
FERC, ensures it is entertaining. It is not real competition."=20
The authority won't help the state escape blackouts this summer, but will=
=20
help restore reliable and affordable electricity in the future, said consum=
er=20
advocate Harvey Rosenfield with the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer=20
Rights.=20
"The agency is California's key to survival and independence from the energ=
y=20
cartel," he said.=20
Davis and state lawmakers are also considering purchasing Southern Californ=
ia=20
Edison's transmission system, which would be governed by a separate public=
=20
authority. Negotiations with San Diego Gas & Electric Co. are continuing. T=
he=20
Legislature would have to approve those buys.=20
The authority's main power would be over generator construction, said=20
Stanford University economist Frank Wolak. Energy companies would likely be=
=20
hired to build the plants, something the companies are already pursuing.=20
"As far as operating power plants, we're not as good as these other guys=20
are," he said.=20
However, the authority may speed the siting of power plants, an approval=20
process mostly anchored in state agencies. Centering the approval process i=
n=20
the state government could speed the process, he said.=20
Richard Sklar, the governor's new energy czar, said the goal of the state's=
=20
power authority will be to balance the energy market in California and keep=
=20
private companies from controlling the prices.=20
"The power authority is a sensible long-term strategy," Sklar said. "It's n=
ot=20
a bad idea for the state, if the private sector will not build it, to build=
=20
plants so supply won't fall short of demand and this game won't be able to =

Opponents said California should create total deregulation of the electrici=

The 24-14 vote on the bill, written by San Francisco Democratic Sen. John=

GOP Tries to Force Its Dramatically Different Energy Plan on Governor=20
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO, Times Staff Writer=20

?????SACRAMENTO--Republican lawmakers are trying to force Gov. Gray Davis=
=20
into a dramatically different exit strategy for the energy crisis: writing=
=20
off the $5 billion the state has already spent on electricity and borrowing=
=20
billions less to finance future power purchases.
?????GOP lawmakers are holding up emergency legislation needed to replenish=
=20
the budget for power costs, because they don't think the Democratic=20
governor's plan to get California out of the power business will work. They=
=20
say the plan is full of dangerously optimistic assumptions, such as estimat=
es=20
that 90% of the state's alternative energy producers will be generating=20
electricity this summer--only two-thirds are now--and that Californians wil=
l=20
use 7% less electricity.
?????Although Republicans don't control either house, the emergency=20
legislation requires a two-thirds vote, which gives the GOP significant swa=
y.
?????The plan from the Republican leadership would commit taxpayer money fo=
r=20
the first time to an electricity problem that has only affected customers o=
f=20
private utilities. Because the plan is sure to draw strong opposition from=
=20
politicians in Los Angeles and other areas served by public power agencies,=
=20
Republicans have included a complex, $1.5-billion proposal to provide refun=
ds=20
to those served by municipal utilities.
?????By blocking the emergency legislation, Republicans may stop state=20
Treasurer Phil Angelides from securing a $4.13-billion loan to repay state=
=20
coffers for electricity purchases--a failure that would reduce the money=20
available to Davis for his next budget and possibly delay his plan to resol=
ve=20
the energy crisis. Angelides needs the bill to guarantee repayment for the=
=20
loan.
?????If Angelides does not obtain legislative approval by Monday, he will=
=20
miss a Tuesday deadline lenders had given him to close the loan. That would=
=20
clearly leave Davis with less money for new education, police and=20
road-building programs as he begins planning his next budget this month.
?????Moreover, failure to pass the bill could delay a record bond issue tha=
t=20
Davis promised would replenish the budget and shield it from further energy=
=20
drains by summer. And it could harm sagging confidence on Wall Street that=
=20
California can deliver on its plans to manage the energy crisis, Angelides=
=20
said.
?????California's credit rating has already been downgraded by one credit=
=20
agency, Standard & Poor's, largely because of concerns about the effect of=
=20
electricity purchases on state finances.

?????Negotiations Are Continuing
?????"The Republicans appear to be digging in and playing a dangerous game =
of=20
financial roulette with the state. This is really ludicrous to me," Angelid=
es=20
said. "Standard & Poor's has already downgraded us. The other credit rating=
=20
agencies are watching. I just don't understand what the Republicans are=20
thinking."
?????Said Assembly Republican leader Dave Cox (R-Fair Oaks): "We're not=20
prepared to give the governor a blank check."
?????Democrats threatened Thursday to test the Republicans' resolve by=20
bringing the bill to a vote in the Assembly, but backed down. Negotiations=
=20
among legislative leaders continue.
?????To avoid widespread blackouts, the state government entered the=20
electricity-buying business in January after the private utilities became t=
oo=20
burdened with debt to continue purchasing power on the expensive wholesale=
=20
market.
?????Under a plan approved by the Legislature and signed into law by Davis,=
=20
the state budget is to be repaid for the power purchases through a massive=
=20
municipal bond issue, expected to be the largest in American history. The=
=20
bonds, in turn, are to be paid off by utility ratepayers through a slice of=
=20
their monthly bills.
?????However, the plan was based on the premise that the state would quickl=
y=20
bring down power costs by entering into long-term contracts with suppliers-=
-a=20
scenario that has yet to materialize.
?????In fact, California's power costs have gone up since January. Lawmaker=
s=20
initially estimated that $10 billion in bonds would allow the budget to be=
=20
repaid and cover future power purchases. Davis is now proposing $12.5 billi=
on=20
in bonds--and higher electric bills--to finance the state's costs until 200=
3.
?????Republicans are convinced that it will not be enough. They say the=20
Angelides bridge loan is not needed because the state has money in various=
=20
funds that could cover power purchases well into the fall.
?????They also confess to political considerations. Republican legislators=
=20
believe that by allowing Angelides to obtain his loan now, they will be=20
powerless to oppose further borrowing later. The loan Angelides set up with=
=20
J.P. Morgan Chase and several other financial services companies is to be=
=20
repaid with the bond issue. If the loan is not repaid by the end of the=20
summer, the interest rate will rise dramatically, a situation that would ma=
ke=20
it hard for the minority Republicans to oppose more bonds.
?????The strong GOP views were shaped in part by Democratic state Controlle=
r=20
Kathleen Connell, who met with Republican legislators earlier this week and=
=20
shared a highly critical appraisal of Davis' plan.
?????Connell told the Republicans that the governor's strategy was based on=
 a=20
series of assumptions about electricity market conditions in California thi=
s=20
summer that, in her view, are highly improbable.
?????"It is almost impossible for all these hypothetical situations=20
envisioned in their scenario to occur at once," Connell said.
?????But even if all the assumptions came to pass, she predicted that=20
California would still need to secure another source of financing by next=
=20
spring to continue energy purchases. Davis administration officials have=20
rebutted her claim.
?????"I am deeply troubled by this incremental approach to this financing=
=20
that is long-term in nature and is going to burden the state for many years=
,"=20
Connell said, in what appeared to be a reference to Davis' reputation as a=
=20
plodder.=20

?????Using Surplus to Pay for Electricity
?????Republicans, who have traditionally been opposed to financing public=
=20
programs with large bond issues, contend that Davis needs to reevaluate his=
=20
plan. By proposing to essentially forget the $5 billion the state has spent=
=20
so far on power, they are advocating using up the state's projected budget=
=20
surplus on electricity costs, even if it means cutting new government=20
programs.
?????"If Gov. Davis continues down this path, he could bankrupt the state,"=
=20
said Assemblyman Dennis Mountjoy (R-Monrovia). "That would have a far great=
er=20
impact on education."
?????Democrats, who strongly believe that the surplus should be invested in=
=20
roads, schools and to meet other long-term future needs, are unlikely to ev=
er=20
support the idea. Lawmakers are already discussing outflanking the=20
Republicans by drafting a bill to repay the budget on a nonemergency basis,=
=20
which would only require a majority vote.
?????That, however, would probably delay the financing until at least Augus=
t,=20
since nonemergency measures do not take effect for 90 days--giving Californ=
ia=20
only about six weeks to cut the largest municipal bond deal ever before sta=
te=20
coffers begin to empty, according to Angelides.
?????There is another potential consequence: Many of the long-term contract=
s=20
the Davis administration has reached to purchase electricity contain clause=
s=20
that may make them void if the state does not obtain financing by July.
?????"This is a very dangerous game," Angelides said.
?????In other electricity developments Thursday:
?????* Over Republican objections, Democrats in the state Senate approved a=
nd=20
sent to Davis a far-reaching bill that would put state government in the=20
business of operating its own power plants and selling electricity at cheap=
er=20
rates than private companies. The bill, SB 6x by Senate leader John Burton=
=20
(D-San Francisco), would create a state power authority with the ability to=
=20
finance, buy, own and build generation plants and sell the energy at=20
cost-based rates.
?????on likened the proposed government body to the New York Power Authorit=
y,=20
approved by GOP Gov. George Pataki, which brought about a 10% reduction in=
=20
rates.
?????The difference from the current situation is that "the people of=20
California, the ratepayers, would benefit, and not the corporate officers a=
nd=20
not the shareholders" of private energy companies, Burton said.
?????But Republicans attacked the power authority as "more government" that=
=20
would impose itself on an enterprise better suited for private operators wi=
th=20
years of expertise.
?????"This is a horrific mistake and one that California ratepayers will be=
=20
paying for many years to come," said state Sen. Tom McClintock (R-Thousand=
=20
Oaks.)
?????* California Secretary of State Bill Jones, a GOP gubernatorial hopefu=
l,=20
released his plan to address the electricity crisis, criticizing Davis'=20
efforts as a state takeover of the power industry.
?????Jones called on the utilities' parent companies to help bail out their=

Secretary of Energy, Davis Meet on U.S. Plan to Boost Conservation=20
Crisis: Federal buildings and military bases, accounting for 1.5% of state'=
s=20
usage, will cut back.=20

By RICHARD SIMON and DAN MORAIN, Times Staff Writers=20

?????SACRAMENTO--In a visit meant to underscore the Bush administration's=
=20
heightened concern about the California electricity crisis, Secretary of=20
Energy Spencer Abraham met Thursday with Gov. Gray Davis in Sacramento to=
=20
discuss federal energy conservation plans.
?????"I think we have an approach that can result in significant savings,"=
=20
Abraham told Davis. The energy secretary said he was in California "to gaug=
e=20
what we can do to add to what California is already doing."
?????The trip came after President Bush revealed plans for a series of=20
conservation measures for federal buildings and military bases nationwide.=
=20
Those facilities in California account for 1.5% of the state's total energy=
=20
use. Today, Abraham is scheduled to meet with federal officials in San=20
Francisco to work out details of the nationwide program for more than 500,0=
00=20
federal buildings.
?????After meeting with Abraham at the White House earlier Thursday, Bush=
=20
said: "We're worried about blackouts that may occur this summer, and we wan=
t=20
to be a part of any solutions. This administration is deeply concerned abou=
t=20
California and its citizens."
?????Defending his response to the California crisis, Bush said, "As I said=
=20
from the very beginning of my administration, we'll work to help California=
=20
in any way we can."
?????Also Thursday, Davis met with alternative energy producers in an attem=
pt=20
to persuade them to continue operations, despite being owed more than $1=20
billion by California's private utilities.
?????Alternative energy producers, including oil companies that generate=20
electricity as a byproduct of their operations, account for about 27% of th=
e=20
electricity consumed in California. Several have stopped producing after th=
e=20
utilities could no long afford to pay soaring prices for their power.
?????Davis assigned S. David Freeman and former Assemblyman Richard Katz, a=
=20
Davis appointee to a state water board, to be in charge of negotiations.=20
Davis said he hoped that the talks could be completed within a week.
?????And in a sign that major energy companies may get more involved in the=
=20
California crisis, Kenneth Lay, CEO of the Houston-based energy giant Enron=
=20
Corp., met Thursday with Davis, Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg (D-Sherman=
=20
Oaks) and Senate President Pro Tem John Burton (D-San Francisco).
?????Meanwhile, Bush on Thursday directed federal agencies to "take=20
appropriate actions to conserve energy use at their facilities."
?????In California, such measures could include setting thermostats to 78=
=20
degrees, lowering lighting and turning off escalators during Stage 2 and=20
Stage 3 power emergencies, administration officials said. Those occur when=
=20
the state's electricity reserves fall below 5% and 1.5%, respectively, and=
=20
can trigger interruptions in service.
?????Bush did not set an energy-saving target. But the Defense Department,=
=20
one of the state's single largest energy consumers--using about 1% of peak=
=20
demand--pledged to reduce peak use by 10% this summer and an additional 5% =
by=20
summer 2002. That would make available 200 megawatts, officials said, enoug=
h=20
to provide electricity to about 150,000 homes during the summer.
?????The federal government accounts for about 1.5% of total energy use=20
across the country, making it one of the nation's largest energy consumers,=
=20
according to the Energy Department.
?????Bush also offered to make available to the state power-generating unit=
s=20
owned by the federal government.
?????But his efforts failed to mollify Democratic critics, who renewed call=
s=20
for the administration to impose price controls on wholesale electricity.
?????"The generating companies are gouging California consumers while the=
=20
president turns his back on us," Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) said in a=20
statement.
?????Rep. Sam Farr (D-Carmel), leader of the California Democratic=20
congressional delegation, sent a letter to Vice President Dick Cheney=20
protesting Democrats' exclusion from Cheney's meeting this week with=20
California GOP lawmakers.
?????"As we head into the high summer demand months, it is unfortunate that=
=20
you have decided to keep Democrats in the dark about the administration's=
=20
plans to deal with the crisis," Farr said.
?????Bush's conservation initiative comes after Cheney, who is heading a ta=
sk=20
force on national energy policy, was assailed by some critics for emphasizi=
ng=20
production over conservation.
?????"Conservation has got to be an integral part of making sure we've got =
a=20
reasonable energy policy," Bush said Thursday. "But what the vice president=
=20
was saying is we can't conserve our way to energy independence, nor can we=
=20
conserve our way to having enough energy available. We've got to do both. W=
e=20
must conserve, but we've also got to find new sources of energy."
?????David M. Nemtzow, president of the Alliance to Save Energy, called the=
=20
directive an "emergency answer to a long-term problem."
?????"We need to fix the underlying problem by investing in energy-efficien=
t=20
lighting, cooling and controls," he said. "We hope that this crisis will=20
encourage the president to increase the budget for energy management rather=
=20
than cut it by 48% as previously proposed."
?????Political analysts said the effort was driven by concerns for not only=
=20
electrons but also elections.
?????"It's all about political conservation," said Marshall Wittmann, senio=
r=20
fellow at the conservative Hudson Institute.
?????Thomas E. Mann, senior fellow at the nonpartisan Brookings Institution=
,=20
agreed: "The administration has come to the view that just because they can=
't=20
win California in a presidential election doesn't mean the Republican Party=
=20
can afford to kiss off the largest state in the Union."
?????Analysts speculated that the administration came under pressure from=
=20
California Republicans in Congress who worried about perceptions that the=
=20
White House was not being aggressive enough in responding to the crisis.
?????As federal officials search for ways that California can avoid blackou=

this summer, a Woodland Hills-based advocacy group, More Power to You, has=

suggested that the Navy hook its nuclear-powered ships to the state power=

?????The Navy has nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and submarines in San=

?????But Navy officials said it is not technologically feasible to use the=

PG&E Seeks Relief From High-Priced Power Purchases=20
Bankruptcy: Utility asks judge to order grid operator to stop buying=20
electricity on its behalf at prices beyond its means.=20

By TIM REITERMAN, Times Staff Writer=20

?????SAN FRANCISCO--Pacific Gas & Electric Co. asked a federal bankruptcy=
=20
judge Thursday to order the state's power grid operator to stop buying=20
electricity for its customers on the sky-high spot market, unless the utili=
ty=20
can recover the full cost.
?????The move represents PG&E's latest attempt in Bankruptcy Court to get=
=20
relief from actions that the company says are driving it deeper into debt.
?????PG&E asked Judge Dennis Montali to enjoin the California Independent=
=20
System Operator from making the company pay the costs of power purchased on=
=20
the utility's behalf. The company said it recently received a $1-billion bi=
ll=20
for such purchases in January and February.
?????"By purchasing wholesale power at a cost higher than the retail rates=
=20
and sending us the bill, [Cal-ISO] . . . could be reducing the value of our=
=20
assets by hundreds of millions of dollars a month," said PG&E spokesman Ron=
=20
Low.
?????In its motion, the company argued that Cal-ISO is violating bankruptcy=
=20
law by requiring the utility to pay more for power than it can collect from=
=20
state-regulated rates frozen under California's deregulation plan. PG&E sai=
d=20
Cal-ISO's actions would force the utility to seek credit on onerous terms.
?????The motion also contended Cal-ISO is violating an April 6 order by the=
=20
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that said the grid operator could only=
=20
buy power on behalf of credit-worthy entities.
?????That same day, PG&E sought Chapter 11 protection from creditors, sayin=
g=20
it was $9 billion in debt. It later filed a motion seeking to halt an=20
accounting change ordered by the California Public Utilities Commission,=20
which the company says is prolonging the rate freeze and preventing it from=
=20
recouping the cost of power.
?????Elena Schmid, Cal-ISO's vice president of corporate and strategic=20
development, said she has not seen the motion and could not fully comment.
?????But she said Cal-ISO has been discussing billings with PG&E in hopes o=
f=20
determining which payments fall within the FERC ruling and which are subjec=
t=20
to the bankruptcy case.
?????"We will live by the FERC ruling and whatever constraints the Bankrupt=
cy=20
Court places on us," Schmid said. "We have indicated to them (PG&E) that we=
=20
are sending the bill . . . and they should treat it as information, until w=
e=20
can work it through."
?????PG&E listed Cal-ISO as one of its biggest creditors, with $1.1 million=
=20
owed for power purchased from third parties.

SDG&E Blackout Plan Would Pay Firms to Use Generators=20
Utilities: Program in which large customers produce their own power is=20
forecast to cut demand by as much as 50 megawatts, save $1.6 billion.=20

By NANCY RIVERA BROOKS, Times Staff Writer=20

?????San Diego Gas & Electric unveiled a novel plan Thursday to pay custome=
rs=20
to fire up their backup generators when blackouts threaten.
?????The utility said the program could cut demand on the power grid by 50=
=20
megawatts--enough to serve about 37,500 homes--allowing it to avoid or=20
minimize blackouts this summer in San Diego and southern Orange County.
?????"California needs an infusion of new power supplies, but in the interi=
m,=20
we hope this unique program will help shield San Diego from some of the=20
devastating effects of rolling blackouts this summer, including the increas=
ed=20
risks to public safety and health," SDG&E President Debra L. Reed said.
?????The Rolling Blackout Reduction Program, as the Sempra Energy subsidiar=
y=20
has dubbed it, would cost $15 million to implement but could save the regio=
n=20
as much as $1.6 billion in lost revenue, reduced productivity and property=
=20
damage, the utility has estimated.
?????Energy experts are forecasting a dark summer for California, with=20
blackout totals ranging between 20 hours and 1,100 hours. The California=20
Independent System Operator, which runs the electricity transmission grid f=
or=20
most of the state, has said residents face 34 days of rotating outages if=
=20
they use the same amount of electricity this summer as they did last summer=
.
?????The state and utilities have been working feverishly to develop progra=
ms=20
that will reduce electricity use this summer.
?????SDG&E, Edison International's Southern California Edison and PG&E=20
Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electric have programs that grant large customers low=
er=20
electricity rates in exchange for cutting electricity use when Cal-ISO=20
declares a Stage 2 emergency as power reserves dip below 5%. But=20
participation in those programs has dropped sharply because of repeated pow=
er=20
interruptions.
?????SDG&E's "interruptible" program represents 49 megawatts of demand, hal=
f=20
of what it was in October, spokesman Ed Van Herik said.
?????The new SDG&E program, which must be approved by the California Public=
=20
Utilities Commission, would kick in whenever Cal-ISO declares a Stage 3=20
emergency, indicating that power reserves are down to 1.5% of demand and th=
at=20
rolling blackouts are imminent.
?????SDG&E hopes to sign up 50 megawatts of backup generation, representing=
=20
about 40 large commercial and industrial customers, but believes customers=
=20
capable of generating a total of 200 megawatts may be eligible for the=20
program, Van Herik said.
?????"We found a lot of customers are interested in this program," he said.=
=20
"This is an opportunity for San Diego to become involved."
?????During a Stage 3 order, program participants would be asked to start=
=20
their backup generators and then reduce the electricity they receive from=
=20
SDG&E by the same amount.
?????Participants would be paid a monthly fee of $7 per kilowatt of=20
generation capacity. On top of that, they would receive 35 cents for every=
=20
kilowatt-hour of power they generate for their own use. That price is about=
=20
what power plant owners have been commanding in California's pricey=20
electricity market.
?????"We think the fees we are proposing are fair," Van Herik said. "These=
=20
aren't people who are in the generation business, and undoubtedly there wil=
l=20
be wear and tear on equipment and increased personnel and fuel costs."
?????The program, which SDG&E wants to implement by June 1, would operate i=
n=20
compliance with air pollution regulations, the utility said.

Californians who have been sweating for months to cut their home energy usa=
ge=20
20 percent didn't blink yesterday at President Bush's suggestion that feder=
al=20
offices conserve half that much.=20
Sure, some might nod off at their desks this summer, when thermostats at=20
federal buildings will be set at 78 degrees during power shortages. And som=
e=20
will get an aerobic workout, when the escalators at those same buildings ar=
e=20
turned off.=20
But civilians and federal employees alike yawned at yesterday's conservatio=
n=20
suggestions such as "unplug unused coffee pots" after doing everything shor=
t=20
of burning their shoelaces for wattage during the past few months.=20
Conservation tips are so December to any Californian worth his baseline.=20
"I don't think it's frustrating to (us) because most people know what's goi=
ng=20
on, that we're in an energy crisis," said Ansara Johnson, 40, revenue offic=
er=20
at the Internal Revenue Service in Oakland.=20
The Bush administration may be setting the pace in the moving-stair=20
department, however. BART, whose escalators don't run so great in the best =
of=20
times, said yesterday it is looking at operating escalators with an automat=
ic=20
stop-start system to save power this summer. The escalators would be dorman=
t=20
until passengers activated them.=20
"It is kind of ironic, considering we just spent $20 million to fix the=20
escalators," BART spokesman Ron Rodriguez said.=20
Just don't turn them off during peak hours, Ingrid Severson pleaded while=
=20
pulling her massage chair onto an escalator at the 12th Street BART station=
=20
in downtown Oakland.=20
"That would suck," said the 23-year-old massage therapist. "There are certa=
in=20
things that shouldn't be sacrificed."=20
San Francisco International Airport already is turning off escalators durin=
g=20
down times, though the long, long moving sidewalks are going to keep going =
no=20
matter what, spokesman Ron Wilson said.=20
Those with customers to serve, however, embraced the Bush energy plan as=20
warmly as a meter-reader.=20
While federal employees will be working up a sweat this summer hiking up=20
stairs to work, shoppers at Concord's Sunvalley Mall will be coolly cruisin=
g=20
down the moving stairs to Victoria's Secret.=20
"We have no plans to shut down our escalators," said Sunvalley general=20
manager Tom McCracken. "How else would people get from floor to floor?"=20
FASHION VICTIMS
The new guidelines could have an unintended effect. They may provoke a=20
fashion revolution among federal employees, not a group traditionally known=
=20
for its couture choices.=20
It's not their fault. There's only so much you can do with postal blue or=
=20
judicial black. But with Bush's directive that thermostats be set at 78=20
degrees, many employees said, something has to change. Like their wardrobes=
.=20
Start with the long-suffering post office sales associates -- the clerks=20
behind the counter -- whom government regulations have shackled in long woo=
l-=20
blend pants.=20
"I still have not heard a clear-cut reason why we're not allowed to wear=20
shorts and the mail carriers are," said Steve Wellington, a postal sales=20
associate in Concord. The former postal union leader said the=20
shorts-vs.-pants debate has been a hot one for a long time.=20
"Look at these pants," Wellington said, offering a visitor a touch of his=
=20
trousers. "These get real warm in the summer."=20
While postal officials were happy to point out that their San Francisco=20
offices have used 17 percent less electricity than last year, they wouldn't=
=20
touch the shorts issue. "I don't think we need to comment on that," said=20
Horace Hinshaw, a spokesman for the U.S. Postal Service.=20
JUDGES GET EXEMPTION
Then there are judges. Attorneys and court employees said the bench needs t=
o=20
take the lead in the casual attire revolution. Ditch those heavy black robe=
s=20
in favor of, say, a black polo shirt.=20
"Black really magnifies the heat," said Napa attorney Paul Carey. "They=20
should allow judges to wear lighter colors, like yellow or chartreuse. If t=
he=20
judges would allow it, every attorney I know would love to wear a T-shirt,=
=20
shorts and sandals into court."=20
However, there was one indication that judges may be thermostat-exempt, at=
=20
least at the Phillip Burton Federal Building, a 20-story tower at 450 Golde=
n=20
Gate Ave. in San Francisco that houses federal courts and numerous agencies=
.=20
A contractor who was working yesterday to install new thermostat controls i=
n=20
the building said two areas were excluded: computer rooms, to protect the=
=20
equipment, and courtrooms.=20
"That was the mandate," said Erik Ahrens, vice president of Syserco, which=
=20
has a contract for heating and vent control. "Courtrooms are on separate=20
units. "=20
At the Ronald V. Dellums Federal Building in downtown Oakland, lights alrea=
dy=20
have been dimmed in hallways, and workers have been encouraged to turn off=
=20
unneeded lights and computers since early this year. Cynthia Mackey, 38, a=
=20
revenue officer for the Internal Revenue Service, wasn't happy to hear the=
=20
thermostat would be going up.=20
"Oh, no. I guess I'll just work at home," where Mackey said the thermostat =
is=20
set at 68 degrees. "If it's set at 78, and with all the employees and all t=
he=20
computers, it would be hot."=20

Even as he ordered a new conservation effort in California, President Bush=
=20
insisted yesterday that finding new sources of energy -- not cutting back o=
n=20
consumption -- is the long-term answer to the nation's energy woes.=20
"You cannot conserve your way to energy independence," Bush said. "We can d=
o=20
a better job in conservation, but we darn sure have to do a better job of=
=20
finding more supply."=20
Bush's comments, his most extensive to date on California's energy crisis,=
=20
called on all federal managers to conserve energy "to the maximum extent=20
consistent with the effective discharge of public responsibilities."=20
As part of that effort, the Defense Department -- one of California's large=
st=20
consumers of energy -- announced plans to curtail electrical use by at leas=
t=20
10 percent by this summer.=20
"This administration is deeply concerned about California and its citizens,=
 "=20
Bush said after a meeting with his top energy advisers. "We're worried abou=
t=20
blackouts that may occur this summer, and we want to be a part of any=20
solution. "=20
While touting the value of conservation, Bush repeatedly identified the=20
limits to that approach. In response to questions from reporters, Bush made=
=20
clear that he would not be confused with former President Jimmy Carter, who=
=20
donned a cardigan sweater and preached the virtues of conservation two=20
decades ago.=20
"It is naive for the American people and its leaders . . . to say that we c=
an=20
be OK from an energy perspective by only focusing on conservation," Bush=20
said. "We've got to find additional supplies of energy."=20
Bush has called for oil drilling in Alaska, as well as exploratory drilling=
=20
in other parts of the West. Members of his administration also have touted=
=20
the expanded use of coal and have floated the idea of building new nuclear=
=20
power plants.=20
SUPPLY-SIDE PLAN
There have been repeated signals that the comprehensive energy plan being=
=20
developed by a White House task force -- which is expected to be released i=
n=20
two weeks -- will focus less on conservation than on boosting energy=20
supplies.=20
Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, speaking to reporters after meeting with=
=20
the president, said conservation plays an important role in helping=20
California through its immediate crisis. Yet developing new sources of ener=
gy=20
is important to prevent the rest of the nation from experiencing California=
's=20
shortages.=20
"We have a crisis and an emergency this summer (in California) that will=20
result in 30 to 35 days of blackouts," Abraham said from the White House=20
driveway. "We don't have the time between now and those occasions to develo=
p=20
new (energy) sources sufficient to meet the challenge."=20
By the middle of the month, the White House will release "a national energy=
=20
plan that will be more comprehensive and more far reaching, that will offer=
 a=20
new vision that addresses Americans long-term supply security," Abraham sai=
d.=20
MEETING WITH DAVIS
The energy secretary traveled to Sacramento last night where he planned to=
=20
meet with Gov. Gray Davis and other state officials. He is scheduled to hol=
d=20
a public conservation event this morning in San Francisco and to discuss wi=
th=20
federal officials how they can reduce energy consumption.=20
An action plan distributed by the Department of Energy calls for federal=20
workers across the country to develop conservation plans within the next 30=
=20
days.=20
In addition, it calls for specific actions during Stage 2 or Stage 3 power=
=20
emergencies, when supplies are within 5 percent of demand. Some experts war=
n=20
that California will be in such a state for much of the summer.=20
Among the steps called for in an energy emergency are setting thermostats i=
n=20
federal buildings no lower than 78 degrees, turning off escalators and=20
hallway lights, and unplugging coffee pots, computers and any nonessential=
=20
appliances.=20
The plan suggests that employees be notified when temperatures might be war=
m,=20
so they can wear more casual clothing to make the heat more bearable.=20
Meanwhile, the Pentagon announced it will reduce its consumption during pea=
k=20
demand hours by 10 percent, and perhaps by as much as 15 percent by next=20
summer. It will also hook up wind generation facilities at Edwards Air Forc=
e=20
Base.=20
Paul Wolfowitz, deputy secretary of defense, said the steps will save the=
=20
state's power grid about 200 megawatts of power, enough electricity for 200=
,=20
000 homes.=20
Energy officials have explored many options, including the use of nuclear=
=20
submarines to provide energy during shortages and firing up the generators =
on=20
the Navy's mothball fleet in Suisun Bay, near Benicia. Both ideas have been=
=20
rejected as unfeasible, energy officials said.=20
Democrats cheered Bush's call for conservation, though several said it did=
=20
not go far enough.=20
IRONIC PRAISE
"I am very happy the president and Secretary Abraham recognized that=20
conservation matters," said Richard Sklar, Gov. Davis' top energy adviser.=
=20
"We thank the president for catching up with the train."=20
Republican governors meeting in San Jose suggested that Davis could do more=
=20
on his own and in concert with other Western states to help California ease=

its energy crunch.=20
It's time, Montana Gov. Judy Martz argued, that California "met its=20
responsibility to build an adequate power supply and stop looking to=20
Washington for a bailout."=20

plan that would pay customers who fire up their emergency generators when=
=20
rolling blackouts loom.=20
The utility is seeking approval from the state Public Utilities Commission =
to=20
place about 40 companies under contract to generate a total of 50 megawatts=
=20
during statewide power alerts. The backup power would be enough to serve=20
about 37,500 homes.=20
``These businesses would actually be sharing their backup generation with t=
he=20
San Diego region,'' Debra Reed, president of SDG&E, said Thursday.=20
The Rolling Blackout Reduction Program would cost the utility an estimated=
=20
$15 million to implement, but could save the regions as much as $1.6 billio=
n=20
in lost revenue, property damage and reduced productivity caused by=20
blackouts, utility officials said.=20
The California Independent System Operator, which manages the transmission=
=20
grid for most of the state, has estimated that residents face up to 200 hou=
rs=20
of blackouts over 30 to 35 days this summer due to high demand and=20
insufficient energy supplies.=20
The use of emergency generators will lead to more air pollution, but Reed=
=20
said the ``social benefit'' of the trade-off would be worth it, because=20
residents and businesses would not have to deal with the safety risks and=
=20
hazards of blackouts.=20
SDG&E officials want the Public Utilities Commission to act on its request=
=20
within a week and hope to have the program in effect by June 1.=20
The program would go into effect whenever Cal-ISO declares a Stage 3=20
emergency, which indicates that power reserves are down to 1.5 percent and=

rolling blackouts are imminent. Program participants would be asked to star=
t=20

Jimmy Carter in a cardigan telling people to bundle up and turn down the=20
heat. Today, it's about using energy-efficient fluorescent bulbs,=20
computerized thermostats and motion sensors.=20
To many Americans, California's energy crisis is a problem isolated on the=
=20
West Coast. Yet it has resurrected interest in conservation that hasn't bee=
n=20
heard since gas lines and the OPEC oil embargo more than two decades ago.=
=20
President Bush on Thursday ordered federal agencies to cut power use in=20
California where rolling blackouts have catapulted the debate over future=
=20
energy supplies to the top of the national agenda.=20
Bush's conservation message came just days after Vice President Dick Cheney=
,=20
who claims the whole nation could face blackouts like those in California=
=20
unless it finds more oil, natural gas and coal, said America cannot ``simpl=
y=20
conserve or ration our way out of the situation we're in.''=20
Environmentalists maintain the Bush administration is using California's=20
electricity crisis -- largely due to a failed attempt at electricity=20
deregulation -- to push through a broader energy plan to drill for oil and=
=20
natural gas in now off-limits areas of Alaska and the West. Hardly any powe=
r=20
plants run on oil, they note.=20
And energy-conservation groups say if everybody made better use of the ener=
gy=20
already being generated, America would not need many of the 1,300-plus powe=
r=20
plants that Bush and Cheney say demand will require over the next 20 years.=
=20
Nobody will have to sit in the dark, they say, if it were made easier for=
=20
Americans to use less energy through more fuel efficient light bulbs, motor=
s,=20
automobiles, office buildings and homes.=20
``In today's world we are not asking people to not use their (air=20
conditioning) -- that is not today's message of conservation,'' said Rozann=
e=20
Weissman, a spokeswoman for the Alliance to Save Energy, a Washington-based=
=20
nonprofit group. ``What we need to do is look at using our energy more=20
efficiently and using today's technologies to help do it for us.''=20
According to the alliance:=20
--If each household in the United States replaced four regular 100-watt bul=
bs=20
with energy-efficient compact fluorescent bulbs, the output of 30=20
medium-sized power plants (each with a 300-megawatt capacity) would not be=
=20
needed.=20
--If the Bush administration's new efficiency standards for air conditioner=

and heat pumps improved energy use by 30 percent instead of 20 percent, the=

output of 138 of these power plants would not been needed during peak use=
=20
times.=20
Americans could even unplug idle appliances -- TVs, VCRs, cable boxes, CD=
=20
players and microwaves -- when they go out of town. Some of these appliance=
s=20
continue to consume energy when switched off. The power keeps display clock=
s=20
lighted and memory chips and remote controls working. The alliance says the=
se=20
electric leaks cost consumers more than $3 billion a year.=20
Conservation does help, according to Alexandra von Meier, director of the=

Environmental Technology Center at Sonoma State University in California. S=
he=20
told a House energy subcommittee on Thursday that residential and commercia=
l=20
buildings use about 35 percent of the energy -- electricity and fuels -- in=

``This amount of energy can be cut in half, if not more, by implementing th=

STATE POWER AUTHORITY
On a partisan vote, the Legislature sent Gov. Davis a bill creating a state=
=20
public power authority that can sell as much as $5 billion in bonds to buil=
d=20
or buy power plants, beef up conservation and renewable energy programs and=

retrofit older plants to make them less polluting. Davis is expected to sig=
n=20
the bill by state Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco, ne=

on=20
said that from documents he has seen, there is "some indication there very=

well may have been criminal aspects to this."=20
PG&E COMPLAINTS
PG&E, usually the target of complaints about electricity bills, made its ow=
n=20
gripe about high bills to a federal bankruptcy judge yesterday. PG&E said t=
he=20
California Independent System Operator, which manages the state's power gri=

charged the utility nearly $1 billion for power that the ISO bought above=

bankruptcy. The company asked the judge to tell the ISO to back off. ISO=20
spokeswoman Lorie O'Donnelly said her agency has stopped buying power for=

PG&E -- a task now handled by the state -- and will await the outcome of th=

bankruptcy proceedings to see how much of its bill it can collect.=20
ALTERNATIVE ENERGY
Gov. Davis met with producers of alternative energy, such as solar panels a=

wind farms, a third of whom have shuttered their operations because the=20
utilities they have contracts with have paid them pennies on the dollar sin=

San Francisco -- A fleet of 13 gray government cargo ships tied up on the S=
an=20
Francisco waterfront and at Alameda is ready and able to provide emergency=
=20
electric power if rolling blackouts hit this summer.=20
"We'd be more than willing to help," said Capt. Frank Johnston, Western=20
region administrator for the U.S. Maritime Administration, which manages th=
e=20
ships. The vessels are part of the country's ready reserve fleet, have crew=
s=20
aboard 24 hours a day and are prepared to sail anywhere in the world on fiv=
e=20
days' notice.=20
The offer comes a day after the Bush administration suggested using ships i=
n=20
the so-called mothball fleet in Suisun Bay near Benicia to provide power.=
=20
However, the officer in charge of the old ships there said yesterday he=20
thought his vessels could not make much of a contribution.=20
"Nobody has contacted us about that," said Joseph Pecoraro, superintendent =
of=20
the reserve fleet.=20
Unlike the ready reserve ships, the mothball vessels are neither modern nor=
=20
set to sail anytime soon.=20
Pecoraro said the equipment on most of the ships has not been used in years=
.=20
To use them to supply civilian power, he said, "is not real simple."=20
"It's feasible," he said, but probably not practical.=20
On the other hand, using the ready reserve ships also has some drawbacks --=
=20
crewing the ships, paying for fuel, and more seriously, the amount of=20
pollution produced by running the ship's diesel generators.=20
Johnston said the ships meet Environmental Protection Agency standards, but=
=20
some environmental activists have grave misgivings. "Nothing could be a=20
bigger disaster for air quality," said Russell Long, executive director of=
=20
the Bluewater Network in San Francisco, which has been highly critical of a=
ir=20
pollution caused by marine engines. "These are very highly polluting engine=
s.=20
They produce a hundred times more pollution per kilowatt hour than modern=
=20
generators," he said.=20
Long says EPA standards for ships "are pathetic."=20
"Ships are the worst polluters on the planet."=20
Several of the ready reserve ships are in highly visible berths in San=20
Francisco. One of them, the cargo ship Cape Henry, is at Pier 27 at the foo=
t=20
of Telegraph Hill, and another, the Cape Orlando, is at Pier 50, on the=20
southern waterfront, not far from Pacific Bell Park. The ship is visible fr=
om=20
the stands and is a kind of floating backdrop to the right-field wall.=20
Nine of the ships are tied up at the former Alameda Naval Air Station, but=
=20
any or all of them could be easily moved.=20
The ships have civilian crews, but are often confused with Navy ships becau=
se=20
they are painted battleship gray. They are intended for use in time of=20
international crisis or other incident.=20
All of them have the capacity to generate electricity. Johnston said he was=
=20
not sure exactly how much power his ships could supply, but it would be=20
enough for emergency services.=20
"We could supply fire stations, or police stations, or hospitals, or the 91=
1=20
network," he said. "There are all kinds of possibilities and we are more th=
an=20
willing to consider any proposal," Johnston said.=20
"It is better to plan now than to wait until the power goes out and then wo=
rk=20
by flashlight," he said.=20
Johnston said he did not have the authority to conclude an agreement with=
=20
local officials himself, but he would be glad "to run a plan up the flagpol=
e=20
in Washington."=20
Power from ships has been used in the past in emergency situations. Many=20
years ago, said Capt. Patrick Moloney, executive director of the California=
=20
Pilot Commission, power from the aircraft carrier Saratoga was used to supp=
ly=20
the city of Tacoma, Wa., during an emergency.=20
However, he said, because of the complexity of connecting ship's power with=
=20
the civilian grid, such applications are rare. "It is a nice idea," he said=
,=20
"but ships are not configured for it."=20

Pacific Gas and Electric Co. may be more amenable to selling off its dams=
=20
rather than its power lines if required to part with assets as part of the=
=20
utility's bankruptcy proceedings, PG&E Chairman Robert Glynn said yesterday=
.=20
In a meeting with Chronicle editors and writers, Glynn stressed that he sti=
ll=20
hopes to get through the bankruptcy process without selling any of PG&E's=
=20
resources to pay off creditors.=20
"But if there is an asset to be sold, it's not clear that the power lines i=
s=20
it," he said. "Our hydro assets actually have a higher value."=20
Glynn's comments may signal challenges down the road for Gov. Gray Davis'=
=20
efforts to acquire the transmission systems of all three of California's=20
investor-owned utilities.=20
Southern California Edison already has agreed to sell its lines to the stat=
e=20
for $2.7 billion. A similar accord is expected to be reached with San Diego=
=20
Gas & Electric.=20
However, critics have said Davis would be purchasing a white elephant if he=
=20
manages to buy only about a third of the statewide electricity grid. Withou=
t=20
PG&E's lines, the Edison and San Diego systems would be of lesser value.=20
Glynn noted that he had tentatively agreed to sell off PG&E's power lines f=
or=20
an undisclosed sum before the utility's negotiations with the state collaps=
ed=20
in March.=20
"But I've said pretty clearly that I don't want to sell off any part of our=
=20
business," he said.=20
Glynn defended his decision to file for bankruptcy by saying it was the mos=
t=20
efficient way to restore cash-strapped PG&E to credit-worthiness. The utili=
ty=20
has racked up about $9 billion in debt because of runaway wholesale power=
=20
prices.=20
"The company's got to be able to pay its bills," Glynn said. "We expect to=
=20
pay all of our valid debts."=20
He said PG&E will submit a proposed reorganization plan to the bankruptcy=
=20
court in San Francisco by early August. That plan may include aspects of th=
e=20
bailout accord reached between Davis and Edison.=20
"If an element of it makes sense for us, we would be comfortable including=
=20
it," Glynn said.=20
He said it appears likely that an average 40 percent rate increase already=
=20
approved by state regulators will cover current energy purchases and that n=
o=20
further rate hikes may be required.=20
Under this plan, the current average monthly PG&E electricity bill of $60=
=20
will rise by about $18.=20
However, Glynn said the need for higher power bills will not be clear until=
=20
the Public Utilities Commission decides how it will divide existing rates=
=20
between PG&E and the state Department of Water Resources, which is spending=
=20
about $50 million a day to keep California's lights on.=20
"If the state wants to take all the money, then a solution does not exist,"=
=20
he said.=20
Glynn said that despite recent progress in getting Californians to conserve=
=20
energy, he believes the only way the state will solve its long-term power=
=20
woes will be to build more generating facilities.=20
"It is my personal belief that it's not possible to conserve our way back t=
o=20
a stable supply-and-demand balance," he said. "We've got to get back to the=
=20
point where we have enough supply to meet demand every day of the year."=20

Bush shifts policy on conservation after meeting with GOP=20
Posted at 10:06 p.m. PDT Thursday, May 3, 2001=20
BY JIM PUZZANGHERA=20

Mercury News Washington Bureau=20


WASHINGTON -- On Monday, Vice President Dick Cheney used a major speech to=
=20
largely dismiss energy conservation as an outdated notion from the 1970s. O=
n=20
Thursday, President George W. Bush announced a major initiative to force=20
federal facilities in California and nationwide to conserve energy to try t=
o=20
avoid blackouts.=20
What happened in those three days?=20
The impetus for the shift appears to have been a one-hour meeting Tuesday=
=20
between Cheney and 18 Republican members of Congress from California on=20
Capitol Hill.=20
An energy conservation plan for federal agencies was brought up by=20
congressional Republicans, according to two participants. And the political=
=20
ramifications on the party of appearing to do nothing to ease the crisis we=
re=20
discussed . No Democrats were invited, even though they outnumber Republica=
ns=20
in the state's congressional delegation 32 to 20 and the meeting was suppos=
ed=20
to look at federal help for the California crisis.=20
Some California Republicans have been griping that the White House has not=
=20
been showing enough concern for the state as it continues to struggle throu=
gh=20
its energy crisis. Bush, who lost California by 1.3 million votes in=20
November, and top members of his administration have consistently stressed=
=20
that the crisis is largely California's to solve.=20
``I think there was a need for the administration to begin to weigh in on=
=20
this thing especially because there's been so much finger-pointing. Democra=
ts=20
have been trying to divert the real blame away from'' Gov. Gray Davis, said=
=20
Rep. George Radanovich, R-Fresno, who attended the meeting. ``I mentioned t=
o=20
the vice president that politically speaking we don't want that to happen. =
We=20
want the blame to rest where it deserves to rest, with the governor. And th=
ey=20
need to be concerned about that for politics in California.''=20
Damage control=20
Democrats, like Rep. Sam Farr, D-Salinas, said Thursday it's obvious the=20
White House got the message and the conservation plan is an attempt at dama=
ge=20
control.=20
The president is ``worried the blackouts may be known as the `Bush Blackout=
s'=20
and he wants them to be known as the `Davis Blackouts,'? '' said Farr, head=
=20
of the state's Democratic congressional delegation. He wrote to Cheney on=
=20
Thursday expressing ``extreme disappointment'' that the vice president had=
=20
excluded Democrats from the Tuesday meeting. Despite several requests, Farr=
=20
and his Democratic colleagues have yet to meet with Cheney or any other top=
=20
administration officials on the issue.=20
Bush on Thursday denied there was any change in policy.=20
``What the vice president and I understand is that you cannot conserve your=
=20
way to energy independence,'' Bush said Thursday after meeting with Energy=
=20
Secretary Spencer Abraham and Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz. ``We=
=20
can do a better job in conservation, but we darn sure have to do a better j=
ob=20
of finding more supply.''=20
A task force headed by Cheney is finalizing a national energy plan that is=
=20
expected to put is major emphasis on increasing supply through more drillin=
g=20
for oil and natural gas and greater use of coal and nuclear power.=20
Bush emphasized that ``this administration is deeply concerned about=20
California and its citizens'' as he instructed federal agencies to reduce=
=20
their energy usage during Stage 2 or 3 power emergencies in California. The=
=20
directive will extend to other states that find themselves facing blackouts=
=20
this summer, such as those in the Pacific Northwest and the Northeast.=20
Steps to conserve=20
Among the measures, administration officials said, will be turning up=20
thermostats to 78 degrees, darkening interior hallways and pre-cooling=20
buildings at night. Wolfowitz said the Defense Department expected to reduc=
e=20
its usage in California by 10 percent over last year and plans to hook up a=
n=20
idle wind-powered generating facility at Edwards Air Force Base. All told,=
=20
the Defense Department hopes to make about 200 megawatts of power available=
=20
to the state this summer through reduced usage and added generation.=20
The presidential directive follows one issued by former President Clinton=
=20
late last year to federal facilities in California and the Pacific Northwes=
t=20
to conserve energy. The Bush administration said its move was more extensiv=
e=20
because it directs all facilities nationwide to conserve and requires=20
agencies to report back their actions within 30 days.=20
Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Huntington Beach, said he and others at Tuesday's=
=20
meeting urged that Bush travel to California. Bush has yet to visit the sta=
te=20
despite traveling extensively through the country during his first three=20
months.=20
``We suggested the president come out, the vice president come out, and any=
=20
members of the administration come out so that the people know we're=20
engaged,'' Rohrabacher said.=20
California clearly was the main impetus for the Bush directive, and the=20
president dispatched Abraham to California on Thursday to discuss the plan=
=20
with Davis and the regional heads of federal agencies. Dan Schnur, a=20
Republican consultant, said that was a good move for the White House.=20
``Substantively, the Bush administration has been doing the right things, b=
ut=20
because they haven't been out here making their case in person, it makes it=
=20
much tougher for their case to be heard.,'' Schnur said. ``After the=20
Northridge earthquake, Clinton had half his Cabinet out here. None of them=
=20
had anything official to do, but you couldn't turn around without seeing on=
e=20
of them on local television talking about Clinton's commitment to rebuildin=
g=20
after the earthquake.''=20
Abraham said the White House has responded to nearly every request the stat=
e=20
made regarding the electricity crisis. But the administration has not=20
delivered the regionwide caps on electricity prices officials from Californ=
ia=20
and the Pacific Northwest have pressed for.=20
The administration even looked into bringing nuclear submarines or aircraft=
=20
carriers to the California coast and hooking up their generators to the=20
state's electricity grid. The idea was scrapped after federal officials=20
realized only a small amount of power could be supplied and that safety=20
issues could not be overcome, Abraham said.=20

Senate plans public power=20

SACRAMENTO -- California is poised to enter the power business after the=20
state Senate on Thursday approved creation of a public power authority and=
=20
sent its bill to Gov. Gray Davis.=20
A power authority, supporters said, will give the state more control over i=
ts=20
wholesale electricity market by building and operating its own power plants=
.=20
State-owned plants could charge lower prices, and building new plants could=
=20
increase supply and ease wholesale prices.=20
If signed by Davis, the bill would create a California Consumer Power and=
=20
Conservation Financing Authority that could issue up to $5 billion in reven=
ue=20
bonds to pay for power plants, natural gas storage and additional pipelines=
=20
and conservation programs.=20
Also Thursday, state Treasurer Phil Angelides blasted a Republican plan to=
=20
use $5 billion of the state's surplus toward buying power, rather than=20
financing the entire amount with $12.5 billion in bonds.=20
Lawmakers ``are playing a dangerous game of financial roulette, putting in=
=20
jeopardy the state's fiscal integrity and solvency,'' Angelides said.=20
Angelides has been pushing the Legislature to pass a bill that spells out a=
=20
limit on the bonds by May 8. The bonds must be approved by then so the stat=
e=20
can get a bridge loan to replenish the state's general fund until the bonds=
=20
are sold.=20
In a letter to Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg late Wednesday, the=20
Republicans laid out an alternative plan. The bonds are to repay the state=
=20
for $5 billion in power purchased since January for customers of Pacific Ga=
s=20
& Electric Co., Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric. Th=
e=20
remainder of the bond issue would pay for future power for those customers.=
=20
Assembly Republican Leader Dave Cox, Sacramento, said taxpayers have the=20
surplus funds and should use that to get out of the crisis, rather than=20
financing the total bill.=20
``There's no need for the bridge loan,'' Cox said. ``This is about fiscal=
=20
responsibility, not borrowing money you don't have to borrow. The state of=
=20
California needs to tighten its belt, just like California ratepayers and=
=20

Judge Dismisses $10B PG&E Suit



By KAREN GAUDETTE
Associated Press Writer
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) via NewsEdge Corporation  -
A federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit
filed against the California Public Utilities Commission by the
state's largest utility, which sought $10 billion from ratepayers.


PG&amp;E had asked the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles to
overrule PUC decisions that the utility was not entitled to the
money, which the utility spent buying electricity on the
increasingly expensive wholesale market.


In dismissing the lawsuit Wednesday, Judge Ronald S.W. Lew said
``PG&amp;E's claims are not yet ripe for review,'' meaning the case
wasn't ready for trial.


Steve Maviglio, spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis, declared the
decision a win for California ratepayers.


``PG&amp;E was banking on winning this case and using it as one of
their excuses for not negotiating with the governor. It appears at
least for now they failed,'' Maviglio said.


But because the case was dismissed on procedural grounds rather
than merit, PG&amp;E said the door was left open for the utility to
refile its action once the commission makes final its interim
orders on PG&amp;E's requested rate increase.


``The court determined that our lawsuit was premature because
the CPUC had not yet finalized its various decisions on PG&amp;E's
request for recovery of its costs to purchase wholesale power,''
PG&amp;E said in a statement. ``Today's action allows us to continue to
pursue the merits of the case on a timely basis.''


A similar federal case filed by Southern California Edison is on
hold, said company spokeswoman Clara Potes-Fellow.


Edison, the state's second-largest utility, would drop that case
as part of a rescue plan negotiated by Davis, which also includes
the state buying the utility's transmission lines for $2.7 billion.


Since last June, the two utilities say they have lost more than
$14 billion.


California's 1996 deregulation law froze electricity prices for
customers of the state's three investor-owned utilities. When
prices rose to record levels over the past year, PG&amp;E was unable to
recoup the higher costs from its customers' bills. The
undercollection, along with a failed deal to sell its transmission
lines to the state, drove PG&amp;E to file for federal Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection on April 6, the company argued.


On Wednesday, the parent company, PG&amp;E Corp., reported a
first-quarter loss of $951 million, or $2.62 per share. The
first-quarter loss follows a fourth-quarter loss of $4.1 billion
that also stemmed from continuing costs in California's power
crisis.







Bankruptcy Update/ PG&E Files Motion to Require CAISO to Follow Federal Law



SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 3, 2001 via NewsEdge Corporation  -
Pacific Gas and
Electric Company has filed a motion in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court
asking the court to direct the California Independent System Operator
(CAISO) to comply with bankruptcy law, its Tariff, and a recent
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) ruling, and stop billing
the utility for wholesale power purchased.


Pacific Gas and Electric Company's motion, which includes a
request for a preliminary injunction, asks the court to enjoin the
CAISO from requiring the utility to pay costs the CAISO has incurred
and continues to incur to purchase wholesale power on its behalf,
unless the utility can fully recover these costs.


Bankruptcy law imposes an automatic stay to prevent parties from
making certain claims or taking certain actions that would interfere
with the estate or property of the estate of a Chapter 11 debtor. By
purchasing power at costs higher than existing retail prices, and then
sending the bill to the utility, the CAISO is violating the automatic
stay provision and could be reducing the value of the company's assets
by potentially hundreds of millions of dollars per month, depending on
the average retail rate, the wholesale price, and the amount of power
purchased by the CAISO. Recently, the CAISO sent Pacific Gas and
Electric Company a bill for January and February spot market purchases
that totaled nearly $1 billion.


The action alleges that requiring the utility to pay more than it
can collect in its existing generation-related rates would be improper
under federal Bankruptcy Code because it is not in the best interest
of the estate, would be an unauthorized post-petition use of Pacific
Gas and Electric Company's property, and would force the utility to
undertake credit on onerous terms.


In addition, on April 6, 2001, FERC ordered the CAISO to comply
with its February 14 order, in which FERC ordered that the CAISO could
only buy power on behalf of creditworthy entities. Both Pacific Gas
and Electric Company and Southern California Edison Company are no
longer creditworthy companies. By continuing to purchase power on
behalf of Pacific Gas and Electric Company, the CAISO is in violation
of its own Tariff, FERC orders, and federal law.
