?
This is a draft of the contact  list I promised you.? There are still some 
typos in it.? I will clean  them up and get send you a draft in the morning 
that is ready for  circulation.
?
This list is made?up  of?people that I know?and trust.? By an large I have 
excluded  sitting pubic officials.? In cases where a given organization has 
several  useful contacts with similar knowledge, I have listed just one 
person for  now.
?
Give me a call at your  convenience, and we can discuss this in great detail.
