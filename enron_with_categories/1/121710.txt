In the meeting today, no decision was made about what to do with Enron's 
16,000 residential customers.   Each of the contracts gives a basic 30 day 
out right to Enron.

That being said, I think that we have a short window to push for DA before 
any public action impacts us in Sacramento.  

I realize that the ultimate action (which I think is inevitable) makes it 
harder for our advocacy on DA, but real $ are flowing out of the company.

EES will give us notice when a decision is reached.

Thanks,

Jim
