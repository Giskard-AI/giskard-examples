The quick answer to your question on the Barton bill is that, yes, it does =
appear to address this tax issue involving interconnections, at least in pa=
rt.  There is language in Title VIII on various tax issues.  One of them ex=
ludes from gross income certain amounts received by electric utilities, spe=
cifically including connection fees.  In the example in the e-mail, the iss=
ue was not fees paid directly, but assets paid for by the generator that ar=
e then transferred to the utility.  Will check on that angle.

In any event, Title VIII (while in the Barton bill) is not in the jurisdict=
ion of Barton's subcommittee.  Instead, the tax title would have to go thro=
ugh the Ways and Means Committee.  There were some energy tax provisions in=
 the House-passed energy bill last August.  Chris and I will consult tomorr=
ow to see if this issue was included in that bill.

Aside from the tax issue, Barton bill would require the type of interconnec=
tion rulemaking that FERC is now conducting (both for connections to local =
distribution and to transmission).  In each case, the cost of interconnecti=
on would have to be comparable to what the utility charges others similarly=
 situated.  I will go back to double check, but off the top of my head I re=
call that the Bingaman draft specifically "socializes" the costs of interco=
nnection.

Does the Barton proposal deal with this issue of tax on facilities for gene=
rators?

Thanks Dave,

The Nov. 1 meeting will be focused more on establishing the procedure that =
FERC will follow to tackle the interconnection issues other than costs (suc=
h as timelines, basic procedures).  ERCOT will present its agreement and pr=
ocedures and EPSA will present a list of problems that members have had.  E=
nron worked closely with other EPSA members over the past several years on =
problems that we have encountered in the interconnection procedures and IAs=
.  EEI will also make a presentation.  (Additionally, as you are probably a=
ware, over the past several years we have discussed problems with FERC hotl=
ine and have also had FERC staff call us to inquire about general interconn=
ection issues -- this ANOPR is meant to address many of those issues.)

At the end of the Nov. 1 meeting, other meeting participants will have a br=
ief amount of time to raise issues.  Donna Fulton will attend for Enron.  F=
ERC then plans to convene a series of meetings to establish generic interco=
nnection procedures and parts of an IA (results due to FERC Dec 14).  We wi=
ll then also submit Enron comments on the ERCOT IA and procedures by Dec. 2=
1. =20

FERC IS NOT addressing the cost issues during this stage of the proceedings=
; therefore, it will most likely not be dealing with the tax gross-up and c=
rediting issues yet.  It plans to deal with cost issues in a subsequent rul=
emaking.  (We certainly understand that cost issues are typically the most =
problematic part of interconnection negotiations, but this is the way FERC =
wants to proceed.  FERC will continue to deal with cost issues in orders wh=
en disputed IAs are filed at FERC unexecuted.)

By way of background on ERCOT, as I understand it, ERCOT basically rolls in=
 the interconnection costs (network-type upgrades) to the entire grid throu=
gh TCOS (an uplift).  However, TCOS are not allowed to be unlimited -- ERCO=
T has the ability to decide whether the generator interconnection is in the=
 best interest of the grid.  Some attribute all the new generation in ERCOT=
 to this method.  We will need to formulate Enron's view in the next phase =
of the interconnection proceeding.

For Thurs. meeting, I think Donna should raise these issues:
-- While certain basic aspects of the IA should be standardized to eliminat=
e the waste of time we usually face dealing with the same problems over and=
 over, the IA should be flexible enough to allow for individual business ci=
rcumstances (for example, the notice to proceed that we have been including=
.)

-- While having timelines and procedures are fine, the larger problem has b=
een getting utilities to actually follow their own filed procedures (for ex=
ample, Entergy was one of the first to file procedures, yet seems to have a=
 problem sticking to their timelines.)  This yet again means that RTOs are =
critical to stop the discriminatory practices and to provide incentives to =
treat us as customers.

--There needs to be more discussion on best practice No.2 below -- Energy r=
esource or capacity resource.  This should be reviewed in the context of FE=
RC's NOPR on icap (Enron just submitted comments that "capacity" as a separ=
ate payment is not necessary in functioning markets.  In addition, "capacit=
y" is not a separately required "payment" in most parts of the US outside o=
f current ISOs (ERCOT does not have icap)).

Attached is the ANOPR, ERCOT IA and procedures.  Susan Lindberg will be cir=
culating a draft of Enron comments on the agreement and procedures.  Includ=
ed on p. 11 of the ANOPR are "best practices" which include:

1. Comparable treatment for IPPs (allowed to be competing network resources=
 for load without having to be designated as a "network" resouce)
2. Multiple interconnection products:  Energy resource and capacity resourc=
e
3. Small generator exemption
4. Queueing with reasonable milestones (10 days to correct deficiencies)
5. Deposits (with deposits over actual cost refunded)
6. Siting: TPs would post optimal and non-optimal sites for locating genera=
tors (this is something that we had asked some new ITCs to provide.  Most T=
Ps have been reluctant to provide this service.)
7. Timelines (very similar to currently approved timelines)

Please provide any thoughts/comments to Susan Lindberg, Donna Fulton, Sarah=
 Novosel and me.  Thanks.  Christi 37007 =20

I skimmed the attached NOPR looking for the approach FERC was proposing to =
take to the key issue we fought over here in CA a couple of years ago.  Alt=
hough I did not see the word "congestion", the implication of what I read i=
s that the generator would pay for his extension cord plus any congestion i=
mpacts that it makes on the grid.  The implication of the last statement is=
 that the generator would put the grid back into the condition it was in "b=
ut for" the new generator.  That is great, assuming I did not skim from too=
 high an altitude.  Did I?

I also read the thing from the point of view of an issue that I had forgott=
en about until recently.  That is, if the generator pays for all of this up=
grade and "but for" stuff, and then "gives" it to the utility, are there ta=
xes due on the "gift"?  When we developed our project in Pittsburg, CA, PG&=
E's initial position was that we owed them for the upgrades AND for the tax=
es on the upgrades (about 35 - 40% additional charge), which they turned ov=
er to the state and fed.  (This is potentially A LOT of money to "waste" on=
 an interconnect, if it is an expensive one.)  Working with Enron's tax dep=
t (I do not remember specifically with whom), we convinced PG&E that taxes =
were probably not due for various reasons, and we mutually agreed to get a =
private letter ruling from the IRS confirming.  (We also agreed that IF the=
 taxes were ever due, that we would pay them.)  I understand that that IRS =
ruling was put in abeyance, pending some sort of law congress was consideri=
ng.  (I may be making this up here as I go along because Calpine bought the=
 project from us and I lost track of the various machinations.)  The point =
of all of this.  Is it reasonable in this NOPR process on interconnection t=
o address the tax issue?  Is it too late?  Is it irrelevant to the FERC pro=
cess?  Does anyone know the status of the law making process? =20

I am concerned about taxes for two reasons.  First, many of the opponents t=
o the proposed NOPR approach thought that all grid upgrades should be paid =
for by the utility and  included in rate base.  (In other words, "all gener=
ators are good and benefit the ratepayers.")  On fundamental grounds they w=
ill resist paying for upgrades.  If they believe that they will get the ins=
ult after injury treatment (pay for upgrades AND for taxes on the upgrades)=
, they will resist the NOPR more strenously.  (FYI to everyone, Calpine str=
ongly resisted paying for upgrades at Pittsburg and somehow got out of it. =
 And guess what?  Now with all of the new plants - ~1200MW added by Calpine=
 within a 5 mile area of 2500 MW of existing - there are congestion problem=
s around all of the projects, just as we forecasted.  ISO is now considerin=
g adding a new zone and/or charging PG&E and/or the projects for congestion=
.  Because PG&E did not, and probably never will in our lifetime, add the g=
rid upgrades so as to include in ratebase, the projects will be hurt.  Beca=
use all of this is not forecastable in the context of developing a project =
in a timely manner, this outcome, exactly as we had forecasted, is why we s=
upported the approach in the proposed NOPR.)  Second, perhaps naively, I am=
 assuming that the tax issue is no different for gas pipeline upgrades than=
 for electric transmission system upgrades.  On a project we are now develo=
ping in Roseville, CA, we are faced with significant gas pipeline system up=
grades in PG&E's system.  Significant grossups for tax impacts of the "gift=
" are are being discussed as I remember for Pittsburg's electric transmissi=
on system upgrades.  Since it sounds like the same issue, sure would be nic=
e if we could get some appropriate precedence going.  Any possibliity of de=
aling with the tax issues in this NOPR?

Please see the attached.  FERC has asked for preliminary comments on its pr=
oposal to adopt a standard generator interconnection agreement and procedur=
es; the deadline for comments is December 21.  After it has considered the =
comments, FERC will issue a NOPR.

EPMI will participate in the Nov. 1 meeting at FERC; an update will be sent=
 to you.  I will be taking the lead on drafting our comments. =20

Please contact me if you need further information.

Subject: FERC ANOPR on Generator Interconnection


Last night, FERC issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANOPR) o=
n Standardizing Generator Interconnection Agreements and Procedures.  The A=
NOPR incorporates the ERCOT interconnection procedures, modified by various=
 "best practices" identified by the Commission in an attachment.  A public =
meeting has been scheduled for November 1st in Washington, although the not=
ice of the meeting is not yet available.  We will forward it when it become=
s available.  The ANOPR is attached.
