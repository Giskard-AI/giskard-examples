Subject: VOICE MAIL

Joe Sutton called and wants to discuss how the vision groups are going.  Have 
they taken place, what are the plans now?  He thinks you should report it to 
the Exec Committee the next time you meet, but Joe wants to see the report 
first.  I have attached below, the response Mary Clark sent to you regarding 
the meetings (in case you want to forward it).  I did not forward this to 
Joe.  I wanted to check with you first.

Also, Joe said he spoke with Ken Lay regarding the Annual Report - Ken's 
concern about the cover and the Chairman's Award is the fact that the winner 
is not pictured on the cover.  The runner ups are there but not the winner 
and he thinks the winner should also be in the picture.





EMAIL FROM MARY CLARK:

Steve, I've attached the results of the focus groups as per my notes from the 
meetings.  Let me know if you need anything else.
