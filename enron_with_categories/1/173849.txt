Interesting info for those of you who follow or have an interest in this type 
of data regarding succes of market liberalisation.  Further interesting to 
note that household prices fell in Sweden and Finland, markets that already 
had liberalised wholesale markets, after furhter market opening to 
residential secotr.  Note fall in German prices, which, despite bad access 
regime, ended up with a suicidal competition in the wholesale market by 
incumbents.  Let me know if you need more/have any questions.   mcs

For your information, please find attached a  summary and a short analysis of 
two reports just out the 18th of July by Eurostat, the Statistical Office of 
the European  Communities in Luxembourg, which present the prices of 
electricity for both  domestic and industrial consumers collected on 1 
January 2000.
