It is important to point out that under the Bingaman reliability language, FERC has total discretion as to whether to adopt a NERC standard.  Charles does make a good point about the deference language.  As written, FERC has discretion to defer to NERC or an RTO to monitor and enforce compliance.  At a minimum, that language should be expanded to include another entity like an EISB.  Similarly, the language should probably be tweaked to allow FERC to adopt standards of an organization other than NERC.

I understand that the NERC needs to be recognized for political reasons - but this shuts out the possibility of a EISB.  Since it recognizes RTOs, it should alos leave open the possibility of yet another entity to perform the reliability standards setting function,  at least allow for the RTOs to work through a central standards setting organization other than NERC.

Per Jim's request, below is the text of the simple Bingaman reliability language for everyone's review.
