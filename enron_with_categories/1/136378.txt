I have received confirmation from Senate staff that the Senate Democrats on the Energy Committee met this morning and tentatively decided to go along with Chairman Bingaman's desire to move up the mark up of the electricity title from later this month as earlier expected to next Thursday, Sept. 13.  They are not sure they can do it all in one day.  Acting on 9/13 as desired now depends on the reaction of the committee's Republicans.  Not sure they will cooperate with moving quickly.  I am on my way to the Senate for an RTO meeting and expect to obtain a copy of the draft electricity language implementing the Bingaman White Paper; the language was just distributed to committee members this afternoon, but I understand that Bingaman's staff had worked on it behind the scenes with Comr. Massey.  Will advise once I have it hand.
