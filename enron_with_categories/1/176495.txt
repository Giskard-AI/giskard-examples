Subject: Daily Research reports


Attached are two research reports that I can send to you on a daily basis. 
One of our many benefits here at our new location is the availability of 
various research sources. The two reports I have attached are from :
The First Union Securities Equity Marketing Group
and
Merrill Lynch
We also have access to Goldman Sachs research, and CS First Boston Research. 
Please let me know if you would like me to continue sending these reports on 
a daily basis, or if you have any particular companies that you are 
interested in hearing about.

Sincerely,
Hank Emery
