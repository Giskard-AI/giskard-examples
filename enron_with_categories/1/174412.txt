		 Subject: Congressman Edwards (D-TX)

Steve:  Congressman Chet Edwards is having a fundraiser in Houston, October 
10th, 5:30-7:30 p.m. at Reliant's Bruce Gibson's home in River Oaks (2178 
Troon).  Drayton McLane will attend.  They are looking for $1000 to host or 
$500 sponsor.  Congressman Edwards has been very helpful with our defense 
procurement issues, and we have contributed to him recently.  The 
Congressman's main request was to include Ken Lay's name on their invitation 
which Ken Lay graciously agreed to do so the Congressman is most pleased.  
Thus, the remaining request to attend and give additional money is up to you, 
although if we have room in our budget and Ken Lay or Tom White were 
available, I would recommend their attendance.
