Steve,

I am an originator in Michael Mann's area of EES and was most recently with a 
consulting firm dealing with new business ventures.

One of my former co-workers (Tony Ekonomou) has expressed an interest in 
adding value to Enron's endeavors based on his Political/Legal/Business 
background.  He is presently enjoying the business development side of new 
business ventures, but can rely on his political or legal background if it 
meets a need.

Kelly Noel Higgason of EES legal suggested I contact you directly to 
determine the opportunity to Enron of a person of this mulit-talented 
background.

Your thoughts and direction would be appreciated.

Regards.  Jeff Baker
