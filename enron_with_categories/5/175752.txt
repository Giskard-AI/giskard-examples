Excerpts by email are fine.  Also, as I mentioned, I am very impressed with 
your background and accomplishments, but I would like to have you meet a 
couple of other people in my group before making a final offer.
Thanks and stay warm!

Dear Mr. Kean:

Thank you for your call.  I am looking forward to working for you.  I will
be available as of June 1, 2001.

I will have the writing samples and resume ready for you on Monday, March 1,
2001.  Should I fax it to you?  Also, my dissertation is quite lengthy.
Would you like for me to forward you one chapter or just a couple pages?

As discussed, I will be available to come down to Houston between March 30
and April 6, 2001.  More snow (as in 6 inches) is expected today and
tomorrow.  I'm only 5'6".  Pretty soon I will be buried in it since it's
snow upon snow.  HELP!!

I look forward to seeing you again.

Regards,

Amy
