I share your perceptions of Jose, though I don't have as much contact as you 
do.  I know also from some recent discussions with Rick (who has also had a 
fair amount of contact with Jose) that he has very positive views on Jose's 
work.  I think we should make a concerted effort to get the feedback and have 
a good discussion about Jose at year end to ensure that he is properly ranked.

This is a good summary of the scope of Jose's responsibilities and the value 
he manages.  This obviously takes a lot of my time as well because of its 
importance, in some ways  like you or Stan Horton, in terms of drivers of my 
P&L.  However, Jose manages this pretty much on his own without much 
involvement from Houston (it is a local effort by its nature), which was the 
point I was making at the PRC.  He has a good grasp of the commercial, 
regulatory and political elements of all of this and keeps them all balanced 
well.  He is methodical and systematic (which can also be perceived as not 
especially dynamic), and English is really his second language, which may 
have hurt him in the PRC.  He is on the job I would wager as much as 80 hours 
a week.  Do we have anyone at his level with as much or more responsibility 
elsewhere in the company?

John.

1) I am attaching a power point file of the key issues we are following in 
the regulatory group as of now. I highlighted a few to further discuss.  See 
below.






2) I am enclosing the descriptors for the items I highlighted.

Jose:

Jim Steffes, Gia Maisashvili and I  are helping Rick Shapiro and Steve Kean 
prepare for their Executive Business Review with Jeff Skilling and Ken Lay on 
this Wednesday, Oct 4th.  Some of the "success stories" that we want to 
include have originated in your region, and we want to be sure that we have 
the proper information on each of the listed activities.

We need to talk today because of the time sensitivity involved here - I will 
give you a call this morning.

Thanks, Jose-

John
