FYI--go to the Internet Strategy one for what you need.

I am pretty sure he will work out with me and Jeff--you can pull the trigger 
and hire him with my concurrence if you feel comfortable enough.

Rob,

I think the meeting with Steve went great.  He asked me to forward you some 
presentations that I have made, and that you would pass them on to him.  They 
are here in reverse chrono order.  Pass my regards and enjoy your vacation.

Cheers

Hamd
