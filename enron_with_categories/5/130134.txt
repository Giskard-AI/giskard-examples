Shanna,

I certainly believe that Jennifer is better than Kim.  Jeff is certainly the 
appropriate judge but she is very young and has a lot yet to learn.  This 
comment is not meant as a cut down at all.   John's questionable judgement 
shouldn't just be trumped however.

My thoughts,
m

Mike and Jeff,

I wanted to let you know that Kim Hillis is being promoted from Sr. Admin to 
Executive Assistant.  

Cathy Phillips, Nicki Daw and Kay Chapman are also Executive Assistants.

Please let me know if we need to re-visit a promotion for Jennifer and 
whether it should be considered now, mid year or at a later time.

Thanks,
Shanna
