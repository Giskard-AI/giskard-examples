Steve

I hope this email finds you well. ?Don't know if you remember me exactly;
however, I worked at Enron for 4 years, working closely with the
Associate/Analyst Program under Charlene Jackson. ?I had to spread my wings
a bit and flew to Reliant Energy to further enhance my career.

As a former Enron employee, I know Enron-candidate material! ?I would like
to submit, confidentially of course, a resume on AJ McCormac. ?AJ is
currently the Executive Director for Workforce Planning (HR) here at
Reliant. ?She is very interested in opportunities at Enron and has the
"right stuff" to compliment your strategic direction and objectives for
Human Resources. ?I am confident that after just a few minutes with AJ you
will quickly recognize her superior expertise.

Realizing how expensive executive search firms can be, advice from a Enron
fan is free.

Thank you for your time and consideration. ?If you would like to contact
her directly here at Reliant, her number 713-207-7162.
