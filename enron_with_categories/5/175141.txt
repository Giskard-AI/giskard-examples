Humberto - I forwarded your resume to Barry Hunsaker who is general counsel 
at EOG Resources.  As you may know, EOG used to be Enron Oil and Gas, a 
majority-owned Enron subsidiary.  A couple of years ago, Enron sold its 
interest in EOG and it became a stand alone company.  EOG Resources has been 
doing very well.  I don't know if they are looking for lawyers now, but I 
think I sent your resume to the right place.
