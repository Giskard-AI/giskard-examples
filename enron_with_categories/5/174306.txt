Dear Steven:

Just to refresh your memory ... we met in June to discuss future job
prospects at Enron.  At that time, you had offered to get me in touch with
someone in the Finance Division (?) at Enron to discuss similar topics.  I
am sorry to bother you with matters such as this, but I am still very
interested in a position with Enron and would like to follow through on
this offer, if you are still willing.  As an aside, another contact gave
me the name of Rob Bradley and suggested that I get in touch with him.  I
don't know if that is who you had in mind, or not.

I am moving my wife to Houston next week, and will be available to meet
any time from Friday, August 4 until Thursday, August 10.  After that, I
leave for a conference in Seattle, but will back in Houston for one day on
Thursday, August 17th.

As for my timetable (which at the time you had told me to keep you
apprised of), I will continue in my position at K-State for the Fall
semester.  After that, I'm a free man.  I have a couple of academic offers
for temporary positions in the Spring, one at Rice and one at UT-Austin.
The latter is very appealing, but would require my absence from home
during the weeks.  As such, I am still wide open beginning in January.

In spite of the fact that I awoke at 3:30AM in order to get to the
airport the day that I met Jim Steffes and you, I got a lot out of our
meeting.  I was very impressed with Enron and what you had to say, and am
hopeful about future prospects with the company.  I remain very interested
in a future position at Enron, and perhaps in Public and Government
Affairs (I hope I have that right).

Thank you for everything.  I hope that you had a nice vacation.

Sincerely,

Mike Sadler
