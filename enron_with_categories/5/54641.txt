Shirley,

I shall talk to him on Monday. The chances are he is a complete misfit
if 2 organizations rejected him.

Subject:	An Interview Request by Maureen Raymond

Vince:

Maureen asked me to set up an interview with you for a summer intern that has
been displaced a couple of times, first with EES and then with EBS.  She evidently
wants him to assist her.  He has some economics in his background.  His name is
Salah M. Mattoo..

Do you want to do this?   I am afraid we don't have any space for him and if we put
him somewhere else, he will not be much help to Maureen.

Let me know.

Shirley
