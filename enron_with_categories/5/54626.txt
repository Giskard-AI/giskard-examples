Dear Mr.Vince Kaminski,

It was very nice to see you in my interview. Thank you
very much for your time and questions. Through my
interview process, I got to know Enron better and saw
many excited things. I think my experience and skill
would be a good fit for Enron and be able to make
contribution with all my exposures. Thanks again for
your attention.


Best wishes

Weidong Tian
