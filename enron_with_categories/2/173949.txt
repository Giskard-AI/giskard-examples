Subject: help with neighborhood

Steve,

I am having a problem with the drainage in our easements in my neighborhood 
and Kevin Hannon suggested I email you.  I live in Garden Oaks (which is 
located off of the 610 North Loop between Shepherd and Yale near the 
Heights).  Our neighborhood was built in the early 1940's, and the city put 
in open drainage (which is basically ditches in the front of all the 
properties).  Over the past 60 years the drains have filled in and leveled 
which is preventing the water from flowing correctly to the sewers, and this 
in turn causes minor flooding and BIG headaches.  

My address is 236 W. 30th Street and the area of 30th Street I am asking the 
city to regrade is between Ashland and Yale (approximately 2,500 feet).  I 
have been calling the City of Houston Public Works Department 713-247-1000 
for about the last 4 years (generally once a month) to ask them to please 
come out and regrade our ditches.  (The Public Works Department only has 
records over the last year because they changed their computer system and 
lost many files including mine.)  For the last year or so I have been 
receiving a more positive response when I call which is: "This is a Code 1 
priority and will schedule as work load allows."  Although this response is 
encouraging, I still feel that my request is falling on deaf ears.  

Kevin suggested that perhaps a call or letter to a city council person might 
help expedite this work request.  I would be extremely grateful if there is 
anything you could do to help me and my neighbors.
