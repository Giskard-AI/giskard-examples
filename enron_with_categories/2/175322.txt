Subject: Our Will


Phil, Karen, Kathy, Steve,

Diane and I are finally getting a will written.  I would like to ask all of
you if you have any objections to being named in the will as executors OR
executing an Advanced Health Care Directive.  An AHCD is document inwhich
Diane and I will state what our wishes are regarding life support.  I have
attached a sample copy for review.  If anyone objects, please reply to me in
the next 10-14 days.  We will be meeting with the lawyer sometime around the
15th or 16th.

Rob
