Vince 
As I mentioned in my voice message I would very much appreciate if we can re-schedule our meeting from July 3rd to either Thursday July 5th or Friday July 6th. Any time during those days will work for me. My apologize, but I forgot that I'm to attend my fianc?s fathers 70th birthday on the 2nd in Montreal  Let me know if you can accommodate either days.
Best regards, 
Peter
