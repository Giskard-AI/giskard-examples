No charges.  I think we should refer these to Carrie Robert and ask her to 
run down the people in the organization most likely to have an interest.  In 
this case, I would get in touch with Andy Fastow, Ben Glissan or someone in 
the finance group in London.  That way, we can make a better determination 
about the value of the relationship, make sure those who are interested in 
pitching them on doing bus. with Enron can be involved. Or, we can make a 
determination to decline.  I think we decide who we want to let in then do it 
for free, rather than charging.

I'm not in favor of charging a fee; that takes the goodwill out of it.   I'm 
open to discussion on how often we host these meetings, however.

I believe that Cindy and I can keep doing these and there is certainly a 
"goodwill" element here...and maybe that is the way to handle it. OR we might 
want to think about "formalizing" this, say once a quarter and sending out 
"invitations" and, maybe, charging for this????I think there are pros and 
cons on all sides of the charging issue.....maybe we should get together and 
discuss? Beth

Beth, we're a hot commodity.  See a new request below to meet with us about

you agree we should participate in this meeting.

Mary -- how do we route these requests?  It seems like Beth and Cindy have 
been the point person for these visits, but I'm not sure how they'll react if 
we send the requests to them.  Any ideas?  thx. kd

		 Subject: Fortune Study Awards



Dear Sir/Madam,

I am trying to find a contact within your organisation who could help me set 
up
a meeting between a member of your Company and members of an Irish Bank who 
are
extremely interested in sending a senior level delegation on a study visit to
recognised leaders in certain fields, in particular the Innovativeness and
Getting / Keeping Talent areas of the fortune survey.

We recognise that you have won awards in these areas of the fortune survey and
would like to contact someone in this field.

I look forward to receiving your reply.

Many thanks
Elizabeth
