		 Subject: Wabash Valley called re: AEP filing

Don Morton, general counsel of Wabash Valley Power Association, a co-op in 
AEP's area, called me about Enron's protest of AEP's market based rates 
filing.  Wabash has filed an appeal in the DC Circuit of AEP/CSW merger (its 
brief is due 11/20).  He thinks FERC is out of control and not carrying on 
its duties.  Wabash is also preparing a protest of the Alliance compliance 
filing (due this Friday 10/6) on the following grounds:

Filing is really a continuation of pancaking
Does not want FERC to approve on a "conditional" basis (expecting Alliance to 
be a true RTO)--Wabash thinks that Alliance simply creates a larger profit 
center for AEP's transmission system

Mr. Morton also had some specific OASIS problem examples that happened to 
Wabash that involved preferential treatment for AEP.  I told him to call or 
email Scott Miller for the investigation.

Mr. Morton and Wabash CEO, Ed Martin, would like to come to Houston to visit 
with Enron about our concerns and about the possibility of making some joint 
filings.  His number is 317-481-2815.  Please let me know if I should set 
something up or if someone else would like to talk with him directly.
