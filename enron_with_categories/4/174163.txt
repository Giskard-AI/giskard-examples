Greetings, Rice  Recruiting Team!

Each of you has been chosen to represent Enron for our Fall 2000 recruiting 
efforts at the Rice/Jones School.  As part of the team, you will be 
challenged with choosing the best candidates from Rice to join our Associate 
Program.

Our first campus event will be a tailgate party for the  Rice/University of 
Houston game, Saturday, September 2nd.  Everyone is invited to meet in the 
parking lot of Rice Stadium.  We will have tickets to the game along with 
beer and sandwiches.  The general presentation will be on Wednesday, 
September 6th, and interviews will be held on campus Thursday, October 5th,  
and Friday, October 6th.  There are a variety of campus events planned, so I 
hope you are all able to participate.

We are planning to have a brief team meeting Tuesday, August 29th, from 9:00  
to 10:00 am in 42C1 (the Gas Control Presentation Room) to discuss the 
Associate  Program, and the fall recruiting calendar.  

I look forward to seeing you all soon.

Sincerely,

Celeste Roberts
Director of Associate & Analyst Campus Recruiting
