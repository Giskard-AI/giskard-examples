Thank you for your suggestions during our phone conversation the other day.  
We took each into consideration when completing the "Condor Information" 
website.

As of this afternoon, the website is up and running.  You can access it at 
http://www.bmni.com/condor/index.html  We are also planning to send the 
letter we discussed out beginning today.

If you have questions, please contact me.

Kind regards,
