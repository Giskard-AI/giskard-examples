We may be able to handle this specific issue outside the policy committee, 
but I think it would be a good idea to set the next one anyway.  I'm sure 
we'll have something we'll need to talk about.

Subject: Next policy committee meeting

Steve, given yesterday's conversation toward the end of the executive 
committee - i.e., countries ENE will do business in - do you think we should 
try to set up another policy committee meeting?  Jeff's schedule is pretty 
ugly for the rest of this month and early July, but could probably do 
something mid-July.  I'm not sure what Ken Lay's schedule looks like, 
though.  Please advise.  Thanks, SRS
