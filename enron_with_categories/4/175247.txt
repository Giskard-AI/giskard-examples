Sorry, I got overwhelmed by California.  I have not talked to Ken yet and 
will be in Japan until Friday.  Perhaps we can hook up then?

Subject: Kissinger

We never closed the loop on Kissinger.  If you are around next week, why 
don't we talk and resolve what we want to do so that I can proceed?  Does 
that work for you?

Rebecca
