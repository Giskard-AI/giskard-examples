Steve, it is my understanding from Andre he will be retiring in early 
December.  Prior to his retirement, I would like to use Andre to assist Asset 
Operations in completing Crisis Management Simulation training at the TGS 
asset in Argentina in November and at the San Juan Gas and ProCaribe assets 
in Puerto Rico and the Ventane asset in Venezuela.  The Puerto Rico and 
Ventane simulations have yet to be scheduled but need to be completed prior 
to year end.

Asset Operations will outsource crisis simulation training commencing in 
January of 2000 but to complete this years objectives, Andre's assistance is 
necessary.
As has currently been the practice, Asset Operations will pick up the 
expenses for his time and efforts.

If you have questions, please advise.

Don
