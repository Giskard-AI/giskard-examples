Hi Jeff:

March seems a long ways away right now, but we are trying to put together
the program for the sixth annual POWER Conference on Electricity Industry
Restructuring, which will be March 16 in Berkeley.   The conference is
divided into 4 sessions, each with two papers.  We would like to invite
you to be a discussant in the fourth session (program below).  It would
involve just a 10 minute discussion of one or both papers and then
participating in the Q&A.  Would you be interested?

Severin
