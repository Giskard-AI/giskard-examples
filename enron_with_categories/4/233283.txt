 I'll call you in a little bit.  We'll be finishing up in about 45 minutes.  
Let's just say, Greg is earning his fee.

That all depends on your definition of the word"job." It was actually 
anticlimactic---Mark told Bob he needed to stick around on some of the old EI 
litigation, a fact we already knew. Are you at the Sempra deposition. how is 
it going?

 He keeps saying that he "needs" the $15 million.  Maybe it's a budget thing. 
I think he really just wants to renegotiate the deal.  I don't think he 
thinks that IHI has the money to pay us back.  
 What happened at the meeting on Monday with Mark?  Do I still have a job?

Thanks. I have no idea why Enerson is being so panicky.
