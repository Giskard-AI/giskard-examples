I don't know.  Can we get someone in IT to respond?

Steve, I believe the answer is that we don't mandate a specific format for 
dates for all locations but rather use what is done locally -- just like this 
employee's recollection.  Do you agree?

Mary, Rick is on vacation and I am monitoring his email.  This question has 
come up before and we sent it to Philippe Bibi.  It is a computer question.

Rick, can you prepare a response to this question for Ken, Jeff and Joe?  If 
you're not the right contact for this, do you know who is?  I need a response 
by Aug. 3.  Thanks.

Dear Ms. Clark,

Here is my question:

Would you allow our staff and customers to vote on Enron adopting the 
International Standards Organization Specification for formatting dates (i.e. 
"YYYY-MM-DD")?

Please let me know if you would like me to send you a list of the many 
advantages in using the ISO standards.

I asked Ken Lay this question a few years ago, but he thought we should use 
local customs; however, as we are becoming more international and more 
internet-based, the ISO standard is becoming more advantageous.

Thank you,
Dave Fabian
