I won't be going.  Let's look for an alternate.  I'd be happy to come to DC.

Mack McLarty and his people would like to get together with you in Los 
Angeles during the Dem convention to discuss our Southern Cone issues, 
strategies, etc.  Will you be there on the Monday?

Steve

Steve:

Speaking of LA, I have spoken to Mack's scheduler, Andrea, and it appears
that he'd be available for this on Monday AM -- don't know how that fits
into the Enron schedule.  It probably makes the most sense to have her
coordinate any such meeting.  How would you recommend that we proceed?
Thanks, Kellie
