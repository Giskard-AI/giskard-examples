Steven,

I understand you indicated to Louise Kitchen the other day that you may wish 
to provide a list of contacts to receive brochures about EnronOnline.

Could you please confirm if you wish to do this, and if so, send me the list 
so I can ensure that it is included in the mailing?

Thanks,

Dave
