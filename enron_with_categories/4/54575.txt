I could not find the issue. I think I have dumped all the copies of the publication.
I am in London next week.

I haven't heard but I guess that you weren't able to find the article on
my going to Southern.  I may be in town the 26 and 27th of next week.
Will you be around?  Do you want to meet up for bkfst or lunch?  Thanks.
