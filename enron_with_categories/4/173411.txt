Steve -

I enjoyed our meeting last Monday and we are hard at work on a different
proposal designed to speed up or progress to the top ranks of the world's
best business schools. As you pointed out this is in our mutual interest as
well as the interests of much of the Houston business community.

I mentioned in our meeting the possibility of your joining the Council of
Overseers of the Jones School. This group consists of about 36 business
leaders, mostly from Houston but also includes individuals from as far away
as Saudi Arabia.

We meet about two times a year for an afternoon to discuss important policy
issues facing the Business School. I have found the advice and counsel
offered by the group to be extraordinarily helpful as we work on improving
the Jones School. The group is chaired by Dennis Hendrix, former CEO of
PanEnergy. I will fax you a list of the members and the charter of the group.

It so happens that we will be meeting next Wednesday afternoon from three
to five PM at Cohen House, the faculty club at Rice University and you
would be welcome to attend either as a new member or as a guest.
Interestingly, a presentation will be given by a group of faculty who have
interests in the area of e-commerce.

I will have my assistant fax this material to you shortly. Should you wish
to discuss this, I will be here all afternoon today as well as all of next
week.
