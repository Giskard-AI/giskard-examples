Vince:

Please approve Mitra's expense report if you have access to your system.

We go on the new system next week and all expense reports need to be
sent in this week or will have to be redone into the new system.

Thanks!

Hello Vince,

It was good to talk with you yesterday. David Rowe and I will be happy to
meet with you for breakfast at 7:00 on Tuesday. I will call on Monday to
set the location.

The URL for our commodity option calculator demonstration is

	http://perun.otci.net/Utility

Note that several of the data sets, which we obtain daily from NYMEX, are
incomplete. NG, HO, CN, NT and CL have enough data to indicate performance.
The others are either missing altogether or the series is too short to be
useful.

If you want to see the currency demonstration, it is at

	http://perun.otci.net/BC

and includes some technical material describing work we did in creating the
site.

With best regards,

Mike Boughton
