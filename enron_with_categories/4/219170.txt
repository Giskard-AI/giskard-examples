The DC Team (Linda Robertson, Ray Alvarez) attended and reported on today's prehearing conference in the California case.  The schedule has moved back about a full month mostly due to the time required by PX and CAISO to produce mitigated market clearing prices and to re-run settlements based on those revised prices.  Testimony by Enron on what it is owed is now not due until October 26.  In addition to adopting this schedule, the ALJ reported that the FERC likely not rule on petitions for rehearing of the July 25 order until October 15, 2001.

A revised schedule is attached.  (To see how it has changed, you can toggle Track Changes | Hightlight on Screen on and off)

The PNW case is moving along on schedule; changes attached are corrections rather than actual changes to the schedule.  Notably in today's case, Seattle and Tacoma waived all cross on TFG witnesses, including Enron's.
