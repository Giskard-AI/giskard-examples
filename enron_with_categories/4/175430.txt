As we prepare for the Mid-Year PRC process, please reserve Tuesday June 5, 
2001(all day) on your calendar for the HR  Functional PRC meeting.   Since we 
will review exempt level employees only, please extend this information to 
those employees who will be representing others.  

In preparing for the logistics of the meeting, please let me know if you will 
conference in.  All efforts will be made to secure video conferencing.

Details are forthcoming.   Please give me a call at 31477 should you have 
questions. 

Thanks.
