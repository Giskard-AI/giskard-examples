Houston has experienced catastrophic flooding. My flight has been cancelled.  
It is conceivable that I could get out tomorrow, but I am wondering if I 
should try.  I could still make the speech if we don't get more rain, but 
given the lack of other reasons for me to go, I am considering cancelling.  I 
don't think it makes much sense for me to go for a 15 minute speech.  
what do you think?
