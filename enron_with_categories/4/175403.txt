working with you as one of our Advisory Board members.

Thanks so much for working on getting us the right person from Enron to be =
a=20
panelist.  The details of the event are as follows:

5.3.01 ePanel=02!
eEnergy:  Evolving Trends in the Deregulation of the Electric Industry
The U.S. electric industry is undergoing a sea change in the way it deliver=
s=20
electricity to millions of households and businesses nationwide. The $220=
=20
billion industry, which has been called the last great government-sanctione=
d=20
monopoly, is slowly but surely being deregulated and opened to competition,=
=20
giving consumers the power to choose their electricity provider in much the=
=20
same way they choose telephone carriers.
Deregulation, now scheduled to occur on January 1, 2002, is coming to Texas=
=20
and with it comes the power of choice for most Texans. Just like you can=20
choose your phone or cable provider, you will soon be able to choose your=
=20
electric provider.=20
Panelists include:
Waters Davis, President, Reliant Energy Retail Services
Brett Perlman, Commissioner, Public Utilities Commission of Texas
Time:
4:45 =01) 5:15 Private reception =01) panelists, Texas eComm Members and me=
dia
5:30 =01) 6:00 Check-In
6:00 =01) 7:15 ePanel Discussion
7:15 -          Networking
----------------------------------------------------
Also, We were planning on hosting this event at Dynegy, however they are=20
unable to accommodate our request due to scheduling conflicts that were=20
unforseen.  We were hoping that Enron would consider hosting the event and=
=20
allow us to use your auditorium in light of this new development.  Please l=
et=20
me know if this is a possibility.  Thanks for your consideration.
