Greetings:

Thank you for joining us for the May 22-23, 2001 Forum on Securing the

asked to remain within the time limits outlined in the memo to

We welcome your submission of any recent article or articles, or their

management and efficiency; or the convergence of power, environmental and
carbon emission reduction policies.

If you have an article or articles to submit for inclusion in the Forum
