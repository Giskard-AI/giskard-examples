Steve, 

Sorry for the delay in tracking down this rumor on a potential ad campaign.
I left a message with Maureen this afternoon and subsequently talked with
Smith's staff person.  She said she was not aware of any ad campaign but she
would talk with the Senator about it when he is back on Monday. 

Have a good weekend and I will call you on Monday.

Dave
