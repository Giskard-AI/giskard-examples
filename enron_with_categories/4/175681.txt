You are invited to a meeting next Thursday (3/22) afternoon at 2:00 to 
discuss energy commodity and renewable energy credits for the Enron Building, 
Center and Stadium.  There are a few efforts that are going on simultaneously 
and I thought it would be a good idea for all of us to meet and get on the 
same page.  As many of you might know, Enron Wind (Michael Payne) and ENA 
(Mike Curry) have a great proposal to retire renewable energy credits from 
our Enron Wind facility to match the consumption of the building and stadium 
(details attached below).  If this proposal goes forward, Enron would be the 
1st Fortune 500 company to "go green" in its headquarters building.  Couple 
this w/ our energy star award, and we have GREAT environmental messaging.   
We'd like to highlight this announcement on Earth Day (April 22nd).

The facilities folks are interested in switching from Reliant to EES for 
actual commodity.  It makes sense to work strategically together on win-win 
proposal that will not only make sense economically, but that we can use in 
our messaging.  The focus of the meeting is to discuss the various proposals, 
and steps for moving forward.   

The meeting will be in EB50MO3 from 2:00-3:00. Please let me know if you or 
someone from your group can attend.
