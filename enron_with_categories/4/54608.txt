As you all know, I am working with Vince to try and develop some effective communication skills programs for your group.  As a result, I am hoping that one outcome will be the formation of a new Toastmasters group at Enron.  Toastmasters is an organization that helps employees
give better sales presentations
hone their management skills
work better with fellow employees
offer constructive criticism
accept criticism more objectively.  

Before I begin trying to work out all of the "details" of this new organization, I would like to know how many, if any, of you have ever participated in this organization or would like to join.  Additionally, if you are interested in joining, please let me know your preferred meeting times (generally meetings are an hour to an hour and a half) such as at lunch or work.  

If you have any questions or additional suggestions as to how I can help your group meet your business objectives, please just let me know.

Thanks,
Anne
