Kelly raised this concern too.  The system is set up so that questions do not 
appear unless we let them -- i.e. we can screen questions and answer only 
those we choose.  Even with that feature, though, I think we should skip this 
one (or just reschedule for a later date).  I'll contact Jim by separate 
e-mail.

Can we get this killed or redirected?  This seems very dangerous.

FYI.  I gotta tell you that under the circumstances the timing of this event
just amazes me.

Hope all is well.
