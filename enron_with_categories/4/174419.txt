I would like to do this, but I have a speaking engagement the next day -- do 
the time zones work out so that I can do both or do I need to find a sub for 
the nov 1 speech?

To commemorate the launch of our business activities and the opening of our 
office operations in Tokyo, Enron Japan requests the honor of your presence 
at a grand opening ceremony and reception.  Please mark your calendars, as we 
are scheduled to celebrate this new venture on Tuesday, October 31, 2000, 
6:30 to 8:30 p.m., Hotel Okura, Akebono Room, in Tokyo.

We are delighted to welcome the Prime Minister of Japan, Mr. Yoshiro Mori, 
who is currently scheduled to join Ken Lay in the traditional Japanese 
inauguration ceremony.  Dignitaries from Japanese government, key political 
figures and corporate leaders are invited to attend the event. 

You will receive an official invitation in due course, but in the meantime it 
would be very helpful if you could confirm by e-mail whether you expect to 
attend. Please respond to Mika.Watanabe@enron.com.

We look forward to welcoming you in Tokyo as we celebrate the grand opening 
of Enron Japan.

Yours sincerely,
