Subject: Congressional Hearing in S.D. on the 11th

Cathy Van Way called asking my view on some names she'd been given to invite 
to the hearing.  (I continue to cajole Jessie Knight to appear.)  During the 
call, she mentioned that the committee intends to invite Steve Kean and that 
she needed someone to email here Steve's vitals so that they could write a 
letter inviting him.
