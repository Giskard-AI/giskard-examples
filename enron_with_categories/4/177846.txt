Sorry for the delay (I had major e-mail problems).  The memo looks good; let's get it out.

Steve,
As you know, we have developed a memo to be signed by Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling reaffirming our EEO, Harassment Prevention and Fair Treatment policies for 2001.  The final version is attached for your review, and if acceptable, to obtain the needed signatures.  

The memo has been reviewed by Cindy, the Legal Department and the OLER group.  Once signatures have been obtained, return the signed memo to me so that our group can begin the distribution and posting of the memo to all US employees.  

Please call me at x37921 if you have any questions.  The signed memo can be sent to me at EB1669c.  Thank you for your assistance in this matter.

 

Regards,
Sandra
